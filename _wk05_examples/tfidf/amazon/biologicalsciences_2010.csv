"10.1086/656863","Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications","0801447992","At last we have the first condense and well written treatment on Cladistics for English speakers. Phylogenetic systematics or Cladistics is a young field relative to the more than 200 years of taxonomic history. The  pioneers textbooks on the subject (e.g., Nelson and Platnick, Wiley),  although excellent, appeared at the beginning of the eighties and reflect  the turbulent history of systematics during the late sixties and most of  the seventies. The rapid maturation of the field during the next decade  rendered these books quickly out of date regarding methods of analysis (the  conceptual framework is still as fresh as ever). Other edited textbooks in  English appeared at the beginning of the nineties, but their lack of  condensation and consistency and their often lack of critical evaluation  made them even dangerous for students trying to learn the subject. R. T.  Schuh book comes to the rescue of students trying to become good  systematists. The book summarizes and condenses the various topics of  Cladistics without loosing important details. It also stresses the place of  phylogenetic studies inside general biological taxonomic practices,  debunking the myth that you must either construct phylogenies or work on  taxonomy and nomenclature. Every student of biology must read this book."
"10.1086/656863","Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications","0801447992","It is an awesome book which contains very good information about phylogeny and systematics in general. Who likes systematics cannot fail to have this book."
"10.1086/656863","Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications","0801447992","Systematics is the art, the science, and the ongoing debate of assigning organisms to phylogenetic groups. If you're from bioinformatics, you may think, \"Oh. Tree-building.\" This book is much more fundmental: it talks about the biological data and philosophical approach needed for any kind of organization. This book informs the beliefs behind your choice of algorithms and data to involve.		Modern bioinformaticists usually assume that tree-building moves forward from DNA or protein strings. That blinds us to the 200 years of classification based on physical features, behavior, and even geographic distribution. In that time, huge numbers of debates have sprung up, too many to list here. A few caught my interest though. First, suppose that \"all pterogyte insects have wings\". The fight starts when an apparent pterogyte shows up with no wings. Personally, I don't see the problem. If having wings is a defining feature, then it's a non-pterogyte, mutations excepted. If having wings is a pattern we noticed but not part of the definition, then the pattern needs work. I'm not a taxonomist, though.		Another debate (p.53) is whether to accept parsimony, the principle of least mechanism, as a taxonomic tool. The objectors claim that it's suspect because of the assumptions behind it, whether or not anyone has \"... stat[ed] precisely what the assumptions are.\" Well, someone may come up with an assumption some day, so we may as well get our objections in early.		This book is distinctly non-mathematical. I don't know all that much, but I do know to ask what background probability model is used to decide whether a similarity or difference matters. That was never mentioned explicitly, but was silently buried in half-page descriptions of jack-knifing and boot-strapping.		It's non-mathematical content is very valuable, though. Its glossary gives clear descriptions of subtly different terms. The chapter on nomenclature, the formal process of naming, was a real discovery for me. I had no idea that the rules were so elaborate.		Perhaps it's the nature of the field, but I was surprised at how few recent references appeared at the end of most chapters. I appreciate the classic papers, back to the 1900s. The 1970s were well represented. References from the 1990s, however, were startling when they did appear, since there were so very few of them. Considering the book's 2000 copyright date, the source material seemed older than I would have expected.		This won't give you any insight into algorithms or mathematical techniques, which disappointed me initially. Once I settled into the biological and historical insight that the book does give, though, I found it very enjoyable."
"10.1086/656863","Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications","0801447992","An extremely informative introduction to systematics.  Breaks down foundational information/concepts in a way that makes them easy to understand and apply."
"10.1086/656863","Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications","0801447992","This book makes a great revision on the development of some of the ideas and methods currently used in cladistics.  Even though it is not a deep revision it succintly addresses the major ideas in which the theory has been developed.  The strongest point that this book makes is the role of philosophy of science in development of cladistic methods (Chapter 3). Schuh scores again in Chapter 6, by presenting the common methods in quantitative cladistics, and by presenting a thoroughly discussion about long branch attraction (a potential nightmare for molecular biologists). It is a little bit too synthetic in presenting the applications of cladistic analyses. It also is biased to applications in biogeography and it presents Brooks Parsimony Analysis (BPA) and Assumptions 0, 1, and 2 as separate things when the aforemention assumptions must be used as part of BPA.	In short it is a great summary of the development of concepts and methods in cladistics during the last 40 years, for such a reason it is a great tool for undergraduate students that my overcome that gap in their knowledge."
"10.1086/656863","Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications","0801447992","Not necessarily just the authors point on the subject of systematics. Schuh provides an objective look at the classification of a taxon and the fundemental basis for understanding such endevors. Although the disagreements of other scientists in the subject area becomes overwhelming, Schuh provides a well written technical look at what is involved in systematics. Surely not intended for a novice in the subject area of biology."
"10.1086/656863","Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications","0801447992","Thanks to quick sending, I could use that book in my class!!"
"10.1086/656863","Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications","0801447992","I added the \"?\" as this is very much an account of the narrow cladistic-phylogenetic approach to a vast subject, so the title could be misleading. Not a book for a biologist wanting to understand systematics, but rather a text for a graduate student working with such approaches."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","I have used databases before (mostly NCBI, TIGR and SWISS PROT) and yet, this book (presumably for dummies) has shown me so much more(which say a lot about me)! It is accurate and gives good step by step guide to how to perform many tasks - from how to find a gene to using the analysis tools and to exploring some of the newer features of these databases - and the areas like you have never looked into before.	It is a well-researched book and the authors are clearly knowledgeable in this area.<p>Even though I have been for a 4-day bioinformatics course (6 months ago), which I thought was pretty good, this book still had so much to offer. Using this book, I was easily able to substitute the proteins of my interest into their examples and generated meaningful hits.<p>The book also covers deeper and more advanced features of BLAST, discusses sequence alignments using several types of algorithm and even has a section on 3D structures. Towards the end of book - it features a section on working with mRNA and building phylogenetics trees - which again are excellent resources for teachers involved in teaching beginners molecular biology.<p>I am a teacher teaching at a Pre-unversity level. The way the book is structured also lends its material to be modified into lesson materials for training students. <p>It is really a great book! Worth every dollar I spent on it!"
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","\"Bioinformatics for Dummies\" is an excellent resource.  It is clear, easy to read, well organized and illustrated.  I was particularly pleased by the colloquial tone of the writing: in addition to being informative, it was fun to read!<p>As a scientist who spends at least half of my time BLASTing, I also read it for accuracy and found it to almost error-free (any errors were in the figures).  Additionally, most of the web pages were up-to-date, although as time passes the links will decay and web pages will change their look.  In addition, the book contained enough in-depth content to teach me several new tricks of the trade.  <p>Further, I believe the book had sufficient background material to educate the novice.  To test this, I gave the manual to a material science chemist and he was able to understand the material, at least until he decided it was more than he wanted to know and quit reading.<p>This is a useful text for those who want to know more than an operational definition of bioinformatics and a must for the library of all bioinformatics users."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","I hold a masters degree in computer sciences (so in fact I am a biology dummy), but always had a strong interest for sciences. So I want to delve deeply into this fascinating area, but first wanted to read a book to quickly introduce me the basic concepts. With this background, I must say the book is a little bit disappointing. You can clearly see that this book is written with the biologist in mind, definitely not the computer scientist.		The biological concepts are not explained very well for a biology dummy, let me explain you why  :		1. Some basic biological concepts are not explained. I wanted to have some more explanation on the basic concepts of how molecular and cell biology works. A lot of times, the autors tell you how to use some tool, but is not always clearly explained to me why, for what purpose they use the tool. For instance they explain how to find a list of related protein sequences, but for me it is not clear why biologists need to have such a list. And this is only one example, I could give much more simular examples...		2. Remember guys, I am a dummy, so please explain me the difference between a gene and a genome before using these terms. And also, I heard about chromosomes, but why do you not explain what is it exactly ?. Also, there are a lot of explanations on how to work with RNA, but please explain me more about the functional difference between RNA and DNA.		3. The explanations on how to use serveral internet tools are too wordy, they spent several pages explaining things that are so intuitively clear like \"click this or that button\", \"use menu file, edit, copy to past your stuff to the computer clipboard\"....		4. A lot of complex terms are or not explained the first time they use it (\"phylogenic\"). Sometimes these terms are explained further in the book,  but from a didactical standpoint, you should at least give an informal definition when you first use some concepts...		Conclusion:  I currently read the first hundred pages of the book and maybe I will change this review later on. But I can already tell : the first chapters might be well suited for a computer dummy, but definitely not for a biology dummy. However with some help of the internet(for instance there is an excellent explanation on how cells work at the howstuffworks website http://science.howstuffworks.com/cell.htm), I will continue to read the book further. Maybe after that I will need to change my preview..."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","I am a couple years into a PhD in bioinformatics, but this is the book I started with.  I knew some biology and some computer science, but I still found a lot of the databases, etc. confusing and the field has a decided lack of simplified documentation (though it is getting better).		Of course, bioinformatics is a pretty broad topic and no book could possibly cover everything.		If you do not know any biology at all you probably should also get a basic text on genetics/molecular biology (or read thema at the NCBI web site books section for free).  You don't need anything in depth to read the dummies book, just at the level of an introductory biology book.  Hint: DNA to RNA, RNA to Protein.  And  you want to know why proteins are similar because proteins with similar amino acid sequences often have similar chemical properties and therefore similar functions, so if you know what one protein does you can guess what a protein like it probably does.	:-)		And despite the name of the book the authors are REAL bioinformaticists (T-Coffee rocks!)"
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","This is an excellent introduction to Bioinformatics. It does assume some very basic knowledge of biology- perhaps a couple of paragraphs could help the total newbies.		Have you noticed that reviews of bioinformatics books tend to follow certain patterns? The Computer Scientists and mathematicians complain that there is not enough detail about the algorithms, the biologists complain that they could not get through the math, and everyone complains that there is not enough detail about their favorite programs! Let us face the fact that this is a very broad field, and most people that want to learn about it will never design algorithms."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","This book kind of blew me away. Bioinformatics is such a big word.		Then in the second chapter they tell you 'How Most People Use Bioinformatics.' And all of a sudden they have you on line to the National Library of Medicine at the National Institute of Health. They have you looking at protein sequences, and you even understand what they are saying.		This is a 'For Dummies' book. It is written in their traditional style, assuming that you know very little -- well to be sure they say they are making the assumption that 'You likely have a background in molecular biology. If you don't - or if you need to brush up on your molecular biology - Chapter 1 gives you a brief overview of the basics.'		I found that the first few chapters went down pretty easily. By part IV it had gone further than I wanted to go, and I quit reading.		BUT if I were going to be taking a course in bioinformatics, or even thinking about taking such a course, or just looking at a degree in biology, I'd spend a week or two getting around this book. It's written a hell of a lot better than any text you're likely to get assigned, and at its price it's quite a deal."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","The tile might be misleading.		-First : the word \"for dummies\" is misleading, as already explained in a previous review. The expected level of biology knowledge is not advanced, but definitely not at dummy level.		-Second : the word bioinformatics might also be misleading. Especially for more computer educated people, the word bioinformatics is about algorithms applied to solve biological problems. This book however is not about algorithms, it is just about which tools exists and how to use them. You can find the same information for free on the internet at the particular tools websites.		It is like publishing a book with title \"Car mechanics\" en in the book explaining how to drive a car, instead of how the engine works."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","In spite of the title (I don't know many dummies interested in multiple sequence alignments) this reference is written by experts in the field of bioinformatics and is very accessable for the beginner.  I purchased this book as a beginning graduate student so that I could learn which programs to use to compare amino acid and nucleic acid sequences as well as prepare them for publication and this book was perfect for this end.  This text doesn't delve into the algorithms or much theory (which is learned through practice and other sources), nevertheless, I recommend this for the researcher for a crash course or quick reference.  This book really helped me get my feet wet in this area (and recently publish a nice alignment) and will certainly reduce my workload next semester for my bioinformatics course!"
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","There is a lot of the book related to giving you details of particular sites to go to -- to perform various tasks.  And there is details on exactly the screens you will see how you should fill them out.  I found a LOT of that information to be dated and incorrect.		I found the information about the basic Bioinformatics tasks to be relevant and accurate, but many of the details given were not of much use, due to the reason given above."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","Many people are derisive about the \"for Dummies\" series, believing them to be too simplistic and sometimes even an insult to their intelligence. That can hardly apply to this book, as there is nothing \"dummy\" about it. You need a significant background in biology and chemistry in order to understand most of it. You need to understand the amino acid structure of proteins, the structure of DNA and many fundamental principles of data analysis. Some knowledge of the structure and operations of databases is also needed. The authors include a large number of web sites containing additional information and that can run analyses.	 The coverage is so thorough and detailed that this is the only \"for dummies\" book that I have seen that could honestly be recommended as a college text.  And not just at the freshman level either."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","The first chapter is a short review of DNA and RNA sequences, amino acids, and protein. The other chapters teach you to use the free software found on the Internet to work with your research.  Information is also given which helps explain some biochemicals. My skills are in Software Development using C++ language, and I need more information on biochemicals to understand the problems and to develop algorithms to solve them.		My only criticism is that I would like the book to give more biochemical theory before taking up the subject of Internet software.		Overall, this is a good beginner's book on biochemistry."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","I'm glad I bought this book and I will continue to refer to it.  The remit of the Dummies series is to provide a guide to its subject matter without any great fuss.  The text focuses on practical techniques without unnecessary diversion into the detail of molecular biology or computer science.  In this respect it would have been a difficult book to author, readers having come from one discipline or the other.  I agree with previous reviewers that this is well worth reading before doing a bioinformatics course or degree.  Bioinformatics is a new field, and this book has delivered a useful introduction to it without recourse to expensive textbooks full of unreadable filler."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","Good concepts for a beginner ad intermediate level. Concepts are clearly explained and are easy to understand."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","It is a great book for a any college level student,	even with very little background in Biology. They gave	you all the background you need to understand why you	want to do such and such analysis.<p>No painful math either! and some of the jokes are actually	... fun.<p>It is soooo different from other Bioinfo books I came across.<p>A good buy, really."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","I got this book a week ago because one of my profs offered to buy it for a volunteer who was willing to check it out and then make a recommendation on it to the rest of the class. I'm glad I volunteered, and I'm encouraging my classmates to get their hands on a copy. This book wasn't boring. It was completely hands on, and it addressed the topic from the perspective of a biologist, not a technophile-- which was exactly what I needed. It helped me reconcile my love for pure science with my increasing anxiety about needing to be so darn computer proficient to have any kind of job I can apply my degree to these days. I'm glad I got a hold of it early in the semester. I think it's going to really impact my grade in the class-- Oh, and my understanding of bioinformatics!"
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","The second edition is now over six years old. There have been huge changes in that time and while the basics are still mostly correct just about every web site has changed substantially in the last six years.  The idea of Bioinformatics for Dummies is needed now more than ever but it really needs to be current to be worth buying."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","As a Phd student in biology, this book offers great reference for bioinformatics in a clear and smooth manner. it explains briefly the concept behind few notions and then shows you how to search, interpret the data you receive. no previous knowledge of bioinformatics is necessary to have this book. the only problem is that several websites either change/close their website or change the application format and it becomes hard to follow the book instructions. however it is a very important tool for researchers."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","I really cannot imagine a good audience for this title.	If a person has any interest in bioinformatics, they are certainly too intelligent to benefit from this book's obsession with explanations that could only be appropriate for readers that are over 90 or under 9."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","Book should be treated as a secondary source of knowledge that will help to refresh memory about bioinformatics. Easy written, nice for weekend."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","I am a molecular biologist who is familiar with many parts covered in the book but wanted a more conprehensive, easy to understand, overview of bioinformatics.  I loved reading this book and have asked my research student to read it as well."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","I'm SO pleased with this book. I've done some bioinformatics (classes and workshops), but this book really helped me get a grasp on the things I was missing. There's a lot of info and tutorial styles writing in it. They use a few examples all throughout the book and you can easily follow along or use your own information. I'm a mid level user who wants to do more, and this has given me lots of ideas I didn't know were out there. This field moves so fast, that it's nice to get a quick start. I highly recommend this book."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","Very simple and very well explained, I recommend this book to all who show interest in using bioinformatics as a research tool."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","This is overall a good book on bioinformatics. If you like the Dummy series, you will like this book. It's more thorough on the biology side of bioinformatics than on the \"information\" side. However, the concepts are explained in an easy to understand fashion. Worth the price."
"10.1086/655035","Bioinformatics","0470089857","This book will get you up and running on Bioinformatics in no time.  I wish I got this book before I enrolled in a $$$$$ Bioinformatics course.  I got more knowledge and information from this book $$$$$ than the course!  And I am just in chapter 5 of the book and I'm more than half way through that $$$$$ course."
"10.1086/650226","Introduction to Paleobiology and the Fossil Record",1405141573,"Very expensive book not to use color.

The book does have such good points like as to the photo's and diagrams presented in the text, but the book is written with a higher learning in  mind that might leave the common reader wondering what they just read.

"10.1086/655095","The Secret Life of Tigers","0195697901","Simply the best book ever put together about tigers. Valmik Thapar knows his subjects! He explains more about tiger behavior and family life than any other author reporting on the topic. His greatest work is probably on the role of the tiger father--he proves, with ground breaking photographs, that male tiger fathers actually care for and are affectionate for their young. It's a very good book, by the world's foremost expert on tiger family life. I give it an A+ and a must for any true tiger lover!"
"10.1086/655095","The Secret Life of Tigers","0195697901","Until Thapar's observations, there was not much information about the family life of tigers. Generally, male tigers were known to be totally indifferent fathers, sometimes even a serious threat for their own cubs. There have been many hunters reporting about male tigers killing and eating cubs. Valmik Thapar's observations in Ranthambhore tell the opposite. In a more or less stable natural environment, without the constant persecution by hunters and poachers, male tigers meet their family occasionally for eating, resting, and sometimes even for playing.		From 1986 to 1988 Fateh Singh and Valmik Thapar could observe three tiger families, mother father and cubs, resting, eating and playing together. Some of the cubs could survive into sub-adulthood within two years, but even then, there were no signs of any conflict with the resident father.		I enjoyed reading this book from the beginning to the end, and finished it within a single day. It is a very informative story too."

"10.2307/40665193","A Field Guide to the Mammals of Central America and Southeast Mexico","0195343239","This field guide is a definitive yet handy guide that will surely be a classic of its type. It covers all the living species of native mammals from Mexico to Panama (including aquatic species such as whales and  otters). For each species there is a careful description of its physical  appearance along with notes on habitats, ranges (with maps) and behaviour,  as well as  other useful comments such as the best place to see a  particular species,  what the ground tracks look like and the status of  threatened species. It is an absolute mine of fascinating information, much  of it newly gathered or previously available only in obscure academic  sources. There are excellent introductory sections on the main mammal  groups, and good indexes and bibliographies -- in short , everything one  needs to find and enjoy looking at mammals.  But the most unique and useful  feature (as well as the greatest delight -- and why this is a true  classic), are the illustrations - hundreds of beautifully drawn colour  plates painted from life (often in the most demanding of circumstances),  that will allow you to settle important questions like &quot;Is that a  Woolly False Vampire Bat or a Great False Vampire Bat that just bit  you&quot; without flaming your travelling companions. (The book is  especially strong on Bats.) Flying squirrels, monkeys, oppossums, sloths,  deer mice, armadillos dolphins and skunks, they are all here. I would  highly recommend this book both for amateurs and professionals (whether  they are going to central america or not!). Every academic library should  have a copy of it. <p>The care taken over detail throughout make the book  both scientifically valuable and highly readable. It is a true labour of  love -  and just look at this quote from  the author's preface!  &quot;Some species I painted while sitting in a truck, using the steering  wheel as an easel, and some in a tent with a hadlamp at night, but most  were done outside during the day, sitting on the ground or on a log.  The  white background of the plates suffered from a continuous onslaught of  dust, sweat, and grime, and other indefinable debris. Carrying the plates  throughout Central America involved some harrowing experiences, one of  which was a short flight to Tortuguero in Costa Rica. The pilot had at  length persuaded me to put my portfolio in the front baggage hold in the  nose of the plane, and after we took off he realized that the door to this  hold had come open. While the other four passengers agonized over the  possibility of the plane going down if the luggage became tangled in the  propellors, I was trying to follow our coordinates so I could search for my  plates if they fell to the swampy ground below. Fortunately, we landed at a  small airfield, corrected the problem, and lost nothing but peace of  mind.&quot;"

Even if you have to pay full price, buy it!		All that said, I do want to cite De Becker for a few things I disagreed with.	- He has trained himself to be a hammer, so the world, in this book, is nothing but nails to him. He criticizes \"rapport\" as a tool of those who wish to do harm but doesn't even pay attention to the fact that EVERYONE uses rapport with every interaction in their lives. It is innocuous, like air, and cannot be avoided and thus should not be demonized.	- He criticizes martial arts as a poor method of self defense, yet in the back of his book heralds the importance of Women's Self Defense Courses.	- And this is a minor point, but he does spend a bit of time on how awesome his predicting skills and systems are; which caused me to roll my eyes a few times.

On the other hand, at times I found the author's writing style to be paternalistic and self-aggrandizing. He seems deeply impressed with himself and his accomplishments. The book is also repetitive in places, although I believe that may be intentional, to drive home his points about safety and trusting your instincts. However, the chapter on how men and women differ in their perceptions of danger was worth the cost of the book - it gave me a way to explain to my husband why women are fearful in situations where men would not be. His comment that, at the core, men are afraid women will laugh at them, and women are afraid men will kill them, was profound. So do I recommend this book? Yes, because it deals with an important and neglected topic in a new way. But be prepared to annoyed at the author's writing stye."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I heard about this book many years ago, but intuitively, I didn't like the title.  Just goes to show that first impressions and intuitions are not that reliable.		de Becker has spent most of his personal and professional life thinking about, and working on, personal safety.  He also has a writing style heavy on details and logic.  Plus he has the talent of a good lawyer, or a good economist, in talking about very unpleasant subjects in a calm, rational way.		de Becker explains a set of signals (\"pre-incident indicators\") which indicate that someone is likely to hurt you.  He also shows the reader how to disengage from situations that may turn dangerous.  Nearly everybody will personally benefit from learning more in this area.		On intuition: de Becker quotes Ingmar Bergman: \"Imagine I throw a spear into the dark.  That is my intuition.  Then I have to send an expedition into the jungle to find the spear.  That is my intellect.\"  Anyone can advise \"just trust your intuition\", and that leads to a great deal of mis-trust, hysteria, and large audiences for the local television news.  de Becker shines a light on intuition, highlights the parts that really work, and brings them up from the subconscious to the conscious.		de Becker also writes about some other, more specialized areas of personal safety, particularly personal safety for famous people.  The audience for this part is smaller, but if you are famous, then this book will teach you things you need to know -- and if you do hire professional protection, I expect you'll do even better as an informed client than an uninformed one.  And if you are not famous, then this book will still teach you things that are still extremely interesting.		This book covers only one part of crime: people who want to hurt you for personal reasons.  It is skimpy about protecting yourself from people who want to steal from you or otherwise rip you off.  That's not bad -- de Becker does not claim to cover this area -- but he doesn't acknowledge the incompleteness -- you'll have to realize for yourself that you need to read a different book to protect yourself in that area."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","\"I am capable of what every other human is capable of. This is one of the great lessons of war and life.\" ~Maya Angelou		  I think this quote not only applies to the capability to achieve great accomplishments, but also the ability to do the opposite. I never thought I would be capable of sticking a needle in my arm to get high - until I did. I never thought I would be capable of robbing a bank - until I did. That's one of the points Gavin de Becker makes in his book, \"The Gift of Fear\". It's the reason some killers are described by their neighbors as quiet or nice. It's human nature to murder, rape, and rob, as evidenced by the fact that humans murder, rape, and rob. When we see an animal, such as a chimpanzee, kill one of its own, we don't say that that particular chimp is not really a chimp, we say it's in the nature of the chimp to kill. And de Becker says that's one of the first things we have to realize before we can protect ourselves from violence.		  Today's an anniversary of sorts for me. I was arrested twelve years ago for bank robbery. In those twelve years, I've been forced to live with the \"worst of the worst,\" capital murderers, rapists, child molesters, and a serial killer or two (and somehow, forcing me to socialize with these people is supposed to make me more fit for society, but that's another subject). It's been my experience that even the \"worst of the worst\" have some redeeming qualities, they're not all bad, they're not \"inhuman.\" In fact, it seems that, and this is just my opinion, that the ones who seem to have no redeeming qualities whatsoever are the ones charged with lesser crimes like street-level drug dealing. But they're all human beings.		  But one thing I've learned about myself is that if I put drugs into my system, there's nothing I'm not capable of doing, and, likewise, if I live the rest of my life clean and sober, there's nothing I'm not capable of doing.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I didn't want to read The Gift of Fear and Other Survival Signals that Protect Us From Violence a non-fiction book by Gavin de Becker.		I found, however, that reading it both eased my fears in many ways, and uncomfortably raised my awareness in many others. Yes, my relationship with my (then) boyfriend had deteriorated until it was far from good. Yes, he was jealous and possessive, owned a large stockpile of guns and ammo, and threatened to blow my brains out on more than one occasion, but that was a joke. Of course. A really bad one.		One of the myths about violence is that there's no way to predict it.		It's true there is not (usually) a way to predict a specific violent incident at Tuesday at 4:00 p.m., but almost all violence:  violence by strangers; by a disgruntled employee in the workplace; and domestic violence by a partner; comes with many warning signs, which The Gift of Fear explains in great detail.		I was fairly certain, that, when calm and sober, my (then) boyfriend would not shoot or try to physically harm me again. But \"worked up\"? And drunk? There were way too many nights where he became hammered, where he went from the \"I love you, baby's\" to the \"I don't even like you and wish you would get the hell out of my life.\"		Finally, I did get the hell out. Obviously, I was able to do so safely, or I wouldn't be posting this review.		Sometimes the first and only physical attack is the one that claims the life of the victim.		One very important thing that de Becker emphasizes, is that a restraining order will not magically protect you, and victims of domestic abuse are MOST at risk in the period when they are leaving or have just announced they are preparing to leave. No one in a domestic violence situation can afford to relax her guard because she has a restraining order.		I highly recommend that all victims of domestic abuse (whether it's \"serious\" or not) to read this book, and work with a trained domestic violence organization to devise a \"leaving strategy\" that is safe for you. Screw \"giving him another chance\" or \"being upfront that you're leaving, because that's only fair.\" You need to do whatever you need to do, to be safe. It may mean leaving in the middle of the night, or while he is at work, whatever. Trust your instincts.		You are not morally obligated to give a mad dog a(nother) chance to bite.		(Keep in mind, women can be and have been as violent and dangerous as men. Just ask Phil Hartman. De Becker  himself witnessed, as a child, his mother shooting his stepfather, but has chosen to write the book as though the average abuser is male and the victim is female.)		I also highly recommend this book to anyone in human resources, and to celebrities. It is not true that \"nothing can be done\" to identify and protect against about the dangerous disgruntled employee.  There are also techniques to defuse, or inflame celebrity stalkers. And to protect yourself against stranger rape or mugging.		Really, it's an excellent book for everyone to read. When I finally did pick up the book, with a grim, \"taking my medicine\" kind of attitude, I found it interesting, enlightening, a real page turner, and felt so much better once I had read it, about my situation and my life."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","The author describes the telltale hints of abusive personalities in a matrix that is easy to understand.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I read this book about 12 years ago and don't have a copy in my possession, so I can only write from what I remember. I had an instructor at a university who told us about this book. Approximately a year later, I ran into her on the street and asked her the name of the book. I then borrowed a library copy. DeBecker is a security expert for many celebrities and writes quite a bit about his protection consulting service. What is obvious in our country is that persons with severe mental illness get obsessed about persons who appear in the news or entertainment outlets. They stalk them and at times inflict violence upon them (John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, Rebecca Shaefer to name just a few). This book should make those Americans who want 15 minutes of fame question whether the price is worth it.The best anecdote in the book however, was when DeBecker was talking to some prisoners in a jail about his own upbringing. DeBecker grew up in a very violent household, and as I recall he and his siblings witnessed their mother stab their father or some such. One of the prisoners raised his hand and said to DeBecker \"I don't get it - I grew up in a household just like yours, and I'm locked up and you've accomplished so much with your life.\" It was food for thought, and I don't think you could go wrong reading this book or listening to your intuition. But I also wonder why I suspect men tend to listen to their intuition a whole lot less than women."

Both have reminded me that my &quot;uncomfortable feelings&quot; in situations are there for a reason.  We must start listening to our instincts to protect  ourselves and our children in potentially threatening situations.  Instincts, as Mr. deBecker has repeated in both books, are there for a  reason - they are a &quot;first line defense&quot; of what we should pay  attention to.  I appreciate Mr. deBecker's honesty and willingness to take  on these issues.  Safety issues with our children are increasing-we must  pay attention to what goes on in this world and teach our children that  they need to listen to their &quot;feelings&quot; when something just  doesn't seem right. If you care about your children these books should be a  first priority to read and start teaching your children how to take care of  themselves. My children are now &quot;listening&quot; to their instincts  and realizing when something isn't right with situations they've  encountered. Mr. deBecker deserves praise for putting these issues before  all of us. He knows what he is talking about and does a wonderful job  getting the issues across.  Thank you, Mr. deBecker!"

Although deBecker tends to sometimes stray into stroking his own ego with fabulous celebrity clients (somewhat a la John Douglas), those were the only weaknesses in an  otherwise magnificent book about survival. This book did more than just  inform me; it provided me with the key knowledge that my instincts to  survive have been what's saved me.  I'd always thought I had escaped danger  because of quirks  of fate, but deBecker shows that we escape danger when  we listen to our own inner voices.  deBecker shows us all how to listen to  our own intuition......and gives fantastic survival examples in the  process. I'd highly recommend this book, particularly because deBecker  gives hard, concrete examples from which we can truly learn, rather than  esoteric discussions which leave us wondering, &quot;How do I do it?&quot;  deBecker gives us this information in black-and-white, and in examples that  are easily understood and easily followed. I don't, however, mean to make  this book sound simplistic. DeBecker's writing style is excellent. In  many  ways, this book reads like a true crime survival novel....but, in fact, the  survival we're reading and learning about is our own."

I was pleasantly surprised to discover I was wrong.  This is a well-written  book replete with common-sense ideas and practical advice on leading a life  without anxiety.  The author's elegantly simple canons distill a  thought/action process that most of us have all but forgotten in our haste  to keep up with the times.  I say, read this book.

I think this CD should be a gift to all young women, and men, before they begin to date.  There are times that the language may be somewhat advanced for anyone younger than 16 or 17 yrs old, so I suggest the cd be listened to with a parent or a group with adult leadership (drill teams, cheerleaders, chess club, girl scouts, etc) so as to open discussion and help with understanding and trusting one's own instincts.

Moreover,in an emergency situation I choose the person that I want to help me, as opposed to receiving help from someone offering assistance. De Becker says that we would be more likely to pick a &quot;safe&quot; individual from a crowd than receiving help from someone who just appears out of nowhere. I have used De Becker's book in my work with  battered women and firmly believe that his work should be required in all self-defense classes, mainly because he teaches that our brain is the most powerful weapon against crime.

Don't be afraid to be rude when suspicious individuals invade your space, and don't be afraid to trust your instincts when something's not right about a person.		The book falls short from the author's constant plugs for his own expertise and that of his company. Also, his anti-gun paranoia is just annoying. By the author's own statistics, three in four women will, at some point in their lives, be a victim of a violent crime. After our inner voice tells us we're in trouble, then what? He spends a good part of the book dropping names of famous friends and clients, from Oprah Winfrey to Bill Clinton, without mentioning that each of these people are defended day and night by guns. Take the good advice the book has to offer about reading dangerous people, and ignore the bad advice about self-defense. We all have a natural right to defend ourselves from violence."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","'The Gift of Fear' was recommended to me and my husband at a restaurant recently. The person recommending it is a young man, a dear friend of our daughter and son-in-law. He recently returned from a tour of duty in the Middle East. His job was full of danger, so when he recommended this book as \"good information because it reinforces survival instincts, especially when you're dealing with strangers\", I ordered the book the next day from Amazon. It came a couple of days later.		When the book arrived, I noticed the full title: 'The Gift of Fear and Other Survival Signals that Protect Us from Violence'. The book is by Gavin De Becker, who is in the business of protecting others from harm. He knows what he's talking about.		I read the book in a couple of days. Chapter 4, Survival Signals, is worth the price of the book alone. There are seven signals that Mr. De Becker points out, in well-explained detail, that each of us should be aware of when dealing with strangers. They are: Forced Teaming, Charm and Niceness, Too Many Details, Typecasting, Loan Sharking, The Unsolicited Promise and Discounting the Word No. Each of these signals is a means to trust that little voice inside your head that tells you \"No. Something is wrong.\" After you read this chapter, you'll understand why that little voice shouldn't be ignored.		Buy this book and read it, especially Chapter 4. It could save your life.		The rest of the book is well written and very interesting. I think Mr. De Becker's chapter on handguns seems a little shrill re: how many people are shot daily in this country, but I know I'd rather have my own weapon handy in case my loved ones are threatened or my home is invaded. With the ongoing Muslim problem in Europe, some Europeans may wish they had the means to protect themselves as we 'cowboys' do here in the USA. My opinion, for what it's worth.		By the way, our young friend at the restaurant read the book before going on his tour to the Middle East. He was glad he'd read it."

I first read this book several years ago (before I had kids) and I guess the best thing I took away from this book, or the thing that affected me the most - even years later, is that now if a stranger approaches me while I'm out with my son (and if I get that uncomforatble feeling that something is not right) I have absolutely no qualms about removing myself and my child from the situation. I no longer worry about being 'nice'. de Becker makes a point, and I'm paraphrasing, but it was something like 'worst case scenario is that some stranger in the mall walks away thinking you're rude. best case scenario, is by not playing into the person, you could have just saved your child from being abducted by a predator'		I think you have to take it with a grain of salt though. No book anywhere, no matter how well written, will offer fool proof solutions to keep you safe from violence. This book is not Gospel. But it made me think.

For her, it may be of some help, though she's a pretty smart cookie and is naturally suspicious of men and their motives.  Some of the stories are irrelevant, and unless you are a celebrity or are protecting one, I don't understand why so much time was devoted to that minority of the population and their particular issues.		However, the glaring and unnecessary parts about firearms was what elicited this review and the low rating it got.  This is NOT supposed to be a book extolling or criticizing the use of firearms.  There are other more detailed and scholarly works that go into this.  Whether you are for or against the use of a firearm for self-defense is irrelevant here - the author uses his book as a soapbox to give his personal opinions on the matter, and uses flawed logic and bias to push his own views, which could get someone killed.  He waits until the end of the book, after he has won you over with his words and deeds and gained your trust.  Then he tells you that firearms are always bad, that you should do things to them if you DO decide to keep them around that render them totally useless to you if you should need them.  He offers no mention of the fact that they are used successfully to war off attacks millions of times a year - he simply relates a few stories where perhaps they may have been inappropriate to the situation, and even these examples are pretty far-fetched and weak."

The author does not recognize the importance hindsight plays in many of his stories. We don't and can't process all incoming information because either we don't have the expertise to recognize their significance (it took this author to tell these stories correctly!) or because only subsequent events can tell us what they mean. Or because like other kinds of intuition our usual behavior works most of the time and the exceptions serve only to inform us of the rules. That this book completely misses these points can easily mislead readers to blame crime victims. An early assertion in the book--that technology won't save us--is disproved by the story of the celebrity stalker, who was apprehended following a cross-state computer lookup.		Sure, there are things we can do to better protect ourselves and to limit our exposure to dangerous people, but these are lessons that can be drawn without worshipping intuition.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I realize my title is harsh but his entire book is dangerous.		He promotes an attitude of psychology and anti-gun for your defense against psychotics with guns. Guess what? Your psychology and fear never trumps a gun or knife in your attacker's hands.		The most calm people are typically the ones who have had training in self-defense and quality firearm training. De Becker's own sometimes-partner - Dave Grossman - cites statistics (in On Combat) of how well-trained soldiers when they come home are LESS LIKELY than others in their age group to ever commit a violent act. Why? it's because they know that they can diffuse a situation if they have to and they have nothing to prove. They are more calm and they can quickly handle those who oppose them when needed far better than people who are untrained.		De Becker doesn't want YOU to have that skill. He doesn't want others to have the skills needed to handle whatever situation arises which results - especially in young males in their mid-teens through about 28 - a need to test others, to show themselves worthy, to test their own skills (lacking typically) against others, often those weaker than themselves of course such as women.		I read every word of De Becker's book. Fortunately, I've been well-trained. I knew the moment I finished this dangerous book to remove it from the premises immediately on the chance that someone I know might get their hands on it and believe that fear and psychology is what they need to diffuse violence.

Danger from strangers		\"We all see the signals because there is a universal code of violence.\"		We are too eager to judge and disregard our intuitive signals.		The Gift of Fear is about discovering and realizing that everyone has an intuitive signal that you should be paying attention to.  Learn to listen to your intuitive signal and differentiate that signal from fear.  Everyone is intuitive.  To say, I am not intuitive or I have no intuition, really mean you are in denial of your intuitive signal.  The signals of intuition is there.  You are intuitive.		Gut feeling, feminine intuition, survival signal, signals of intuition, it is part of human survival instinct.  Listen to it.  Pay attention.  Take constructive actions.		\"Real fear occurs in the presence of danger and will always easily link to pain or death.\"  This is a good test.  OK, there is fear.  Now, what is the danger?  How will I get hurt or die from this?		If you are afraid all the time, then you will miss the trigger of the actual fear signal that should alert you that something is wrong.  \"Relax\"		\"Children require the protection of adults, usually from adults.\"	All living things need to feel safe, and cared for, especially children, women, and the older folks.		\"Take nothing for granted when it comes to the safety of your children.\"		Rule #1: The fact that you fear something is proof that it is not happening.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Becker certainly has a lot of knowledge to share about various types of violence and indicators of potential violence. It is clear that he has studied many specific cases and extensively researched behavioral patterns leading to crime. That knowledge is shared in chapters seven through thirteen of the book which I will call the \"informative chapters\".  I found those chapters very interesting as they share a lot of practical knowledge which can help women develop a better awareness of potential harm. However, what happens if a person's situation does not fit those outlined in the informative chapters?  This is where the book goes terribly wrong.  Becker proposes that we depend on fear and intuition for defense.  This goes against basic principles of self defense and teaches one to think in a very destructive manner.		Let's start with the title, \"Gift of Fear\".  Fear is an emotion and emotions are deceptive.  We developed the fear response a few hundred thousand years ago while we were hunter gatherers to help protect us from natural enemies.  In modern society, the emotion of Fear can be a real problem.  In fact, amongst the main group of distortions outlined in cognitive therapy, emotional reasoning is amongst them.  Emotional reasoning is the act of believing something to be true just because you emotionally feel that it is true (number 7 at http://www.uwec.edu/counsel/pubs/defn.htm).  This is an extremely destructive thought process that often forms a component of depression and anxiety and is strongly discouraged by an overwhelming majority of psychologists.  From a self defense perspective, emotion interferes with your perception.  A truly talented predator will play with and take advantage of the fear response.		Inside the book, the word \"Fear\" is replaced with \"Intuition\" or \"Gut Feeling\".  I might be willing to go along with the premise if the word were replaced by \"awareness\" but this book even goes as far as suggesting that premonitions can help us avoid danger.  Within the book, Becker suggests that we all have some type of psychic power to predict negative events in the future.  This brings us to another cognitive distortion called a \"Fortune Telling Error\" (which is number 5 at http://www.uwec.edu/counsel/pubs/defn.htm) which is also a main component of depression and anxiety.  So we have a book from an alleged expert who is actually condoning cognitive distortions.  He may be an expert on crime but he is certainly no expert on therapy or the martial arts.  I hope the sellers of \"The Gift of Fear\" start offering the book with a lifetime supply of Zoloft!		Six months from reading the book, after the reader has long forgotten most of the practical examples, this book offers no tools accept cognitive distortions to aid in a person's defense.  There are no mental exercises proposed and no other type of practice offered.  The martial arts teach mental techniques for defense or, even better, avoiding situations where one might need defense.  The concept is commonly called \"total awareness\" - a skill that has been taught and learned through meditation for centuries in the defensive arts.  It is the ability for one to view events just as they are, without judging them as good or bad, without emotions such as fear, and without missing the important details.  It is that ability to notice what is happening around you without being lost in thought or without being bound by emotion or intuition.  It is almost directly opposite the concepts proposed by Becker.		Read the book if you must but keep a few bottles of Xanax handy to deal with the problems you will develop by following Becker's advice."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Gavin De Becker's \"The Gift of Fear\" is the most astute and fascinating dissection of human intuition that I have ever read. As far as I know, there is nothing like it anywhere. De Becker describes -- by way of personal experience and anecdotes -- how we talk ourselves out of the inexplicable suspicions and bad feelings that could be danger signals we should attend to. In case after case, he demonstrates how we actually know what is at the root of these feelings - an unexpected flash of color in a rearview mirror, a man wearing a long coat on a hot day, an attacker closing a window - cues that can save our lives if we attend to the urges that they impel us to follow. De Becker also gives us insight into the criminal mind, helping victims to analyze their experiences and helping future targets avoid being victimized. Along the way, he describes how corporations and individuals can keep merely peculiar people from becoming dangerous. The newsman who tried to rid himself of an annoying fan through intimidation ended up alienating and humiliating the fan, ultimately driving him to murder. De Becker also helps us understand how to fire unwanted employees - firmly and professionally, but by allowing them their dignity.		This book is fascinating to read and reread. The insights it provides into weird (though common) human behavior is very interesting, as is the length to which people go to talk themselves out heeding their inner voices! De Becker tells the story of a professor target by the Unabomber. This man had numerous chances to avoid opening the letter bomb that took his life, but each was rationalized away. While what happened to this man may be rare, many of us discount our feelings, considering them signs of weakness. De Becker, a man acquainted from an early age with violent behavior, might be too intense to invite to a cocktail party. Nonetheless, invite him into your life for the length of the book, and learn both about the peculiarities of our fellow humans and about the enormous and impressive gift - our intuition - that we often chose to ignore."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Everyone can find something of use in this book.  So many times, we are taught that being afraid is a sign of weakness and so, we should ignore all the signals.  The book explains the reasons for fear and shows you how to  use it for protection from danger. It also supported the course of action  that I took when dealing with a persistant and annoying suitor.  This  person helped me destroy a valuable friendship and he couldn't understand  why I no longer wanted to see him. His constant calls at work started to  frighten me because unlike most people who would get the message and leave  me alone; he would keep at it as if nothing was wrong.  Members of my  family and some of my co-workers told me to just hang up on him and not to  talk to him at all.  The author (De Becker) supports this action and  explains why.  <p>This person still calls me, but his calls are becoming  more and more infrequent and I feel so much better when I don't talk to  him.  When I tried to reason with this person, I felt miserable and  horrible.  Now, I still get a little upset, but I can still go about my  day-to-day business with little interruption.<p>De Becker addresses a  person's natural inclination to try and help a person understand your  feelings when they will not listen to you. He also tells you to trust your  instincts when dealing with these situations.  My instincts told me that  this suitor would not become violent if I just ignored him.  My instincts  proved to be right.  I have not been in physical contact with this person  for almost two years and he hasn't tried to find out my home address and  phone and he hasn't started to stalk me.  My instincts told me that he was  so desperate for my attention that he didn't care whether it was negative  or positive.  Any communication (neg. or pos.) on my part would have been  intrepreted as a sign that I wanted him and he would have been encouraged  to do more than he's doing now to contact me.  By my silence, there's no  encouragement and there's no room for him to twist my words or actions. As  this book says, people like this have many issues in their lives and when  they pursue others who are not interested in them, this is a way for them  to ignore their problems.  When you ignore them, you are forcing them to  either deal with these issues or find somebody else to bother.  <p>Also,  this book showed me the signs that would have put an immediate stop on this  suitor if I had just paid more attention.  Granted the relationship we had  was inappropriate and that should have stopped me from the beginning, but  this person gave me signals of potentially bigger problems. From the  beginning, my instincts were telling me this, but I ignored them.  The fact  that he found out my name and phone number at work without asking me, the  way he introduced himself, and the way he tried to manipulate my emotions  and make me feel guilt and obliged to him without any cause were all  warnings signs mentioned in this book.  Unforunately, I made a big mistake  with this person and I have to deal with occasional phone calls. However,  considering all the damage that I caused, I'm fortunate that annoying phone  calls every once in awhile is the only thing I have to deal with (my former  friend could have made my life so much more difficult, but she chose to be  &quot;nice&quot;).  However, one of the biggest things that this book  teaches you is that you can not always control who contacts you.  However,  if you take the appropriate actions, you can greatly minimize the chances  that a difficult situation can escalate into a serious crime."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I heard Mr. DeBecker speak on Oprah about how we have built in signals that cue us and help keep us from danger, if we allow them, and that fear is a gift.  It was interesting and I wanted to know more.  In listening to him and now the CDs, I recognize that there are times I know, just know that I should avoid something but because I don't want to make someone else feel bad, I will go with it anyway.  I bought the tapes because I wanted to hear them in detail and I wanted to give myself permission to love and care enough about myself to keep myself safe.  I also want to develop my inner sense and not be so busy that I don't pay attention.  If I am in error about the other person or event then I can apologize later.  Keeping yourself and your family safe is the most important key.  I am glad I bought it and would highly recommend The Gift of Fear, it made sense."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","First, I'll mention one of the biggest criticisms of this book:  Gavin de Becker frequently talks about his firm and the famous people he's helped. This is true, but of course, he also wrote the book, so he is going to incorporate his experiences into the writing of it.  It is my opinion that he is NOT trying to get people to \"hire\" him because really, it's not practical for an average person to hire Gavin de Becker or his firm to protect them.		That aside, I think this is an important book for any woman to read.  It really has a lot of good points, especially on unwanted attention and stalkers.  One thing he mentions that has stuck with me since is that if someone is giving you unwanted attention and trying to get YOUR attention - DON'T GIVE IT TO THEM.  Even if you ignore him or her the first ten times and finally give in on the eleventh time if only to say \"Leave me alone!\", it shows the stalker or pursuer that it takes 11 times to get a response out of you.  Another thing he recommends is NOT disconnecting your phone line, as that can anger a person, but to get ANOTHER phone line.  Obviously not everyone can afford this, but if you keep your old phone line on the most basic service possible and just have your answering machine and voicemail pick up, s/he will eventually (hopefully) get sick of talking to your voicemail. You can give all the people with whom you WANT to speak your new number and that way you won't be always worrying that s/he is calling you.		The book has a LOT of good tips and helps you really hone in on your intuition instead of being scared of everything.  If you're scared of EVERYTHING, you won't be aware of the times when you really OUGHT to be scared."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I read this book when I was a Peace Corps volunteer. Like a lot of volunteers, I was young, fresh out of college, and couldn't wait to explore the exotic new country I was in... eagerly talking to anybody and everybody, making friends, going anywhere I was invited with whoever invited me. Most of the time, I was ok. Most people really are nice.		But of course I got myself into one too many awkward, potentially dangerous situations and the Peace Corps office gave me this book. It's onhand in every country, for the benefit of male and female volunteers. We're so ready to chalk up any discomfort (or fear) we feel to language or cultural differences. After all, who wants to go to a new place and feel afraid and paranoid of everyone? We're so eager to make friends, find a niche in the community, and to be independent.  This book reminded me of the need to consider personal safety first and be the nice, friendly American girl second.		It's also a great book to read. It balances providing hard facts (strategies used by bad people, like \"forced teaming\") with useful anecdotes from the author's professional experience. The latter part of the book told about the author's work with stalkers and celebrities which was fascinating. What I especially like was that after reading the book, I felt empowered and more confident in myself, not paranoid or fearful.		I would recommend this book to everyone, male or female, but especially to young women going away for the first time maybe to college or study abroad or a class trip to, for example, Aruba."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Reading \"GIft of Fear\" helped me get out of a dangerous and potentially deadly relationship.  De Becker's lesson is simple:  you have fear for a reason.  Reading the book helps you understand the clues that an abuser gives so you can understand the fear.		I highly recommend this to anyone who's been in a threatening situation or has a friend or family member with a similar problem.  This book and De Becker literally are lifesavers."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I hesitated to read this book at first, thinking it was entirely about the  victimization of women. A friend convinced me it was a good read and once I  picked it up, I couldnt put it down.  De Becker shows through a series of  examples that people have come to ignore the basic human instict of  survival. By ignoring fear, we open ourselves to those that would do us  harm. Women and Men constantly put themselves in danger all in the name of  manners. De Becker shows that it is better to appear rude on occassion that  to be a target of violence.<p>The subject matter is captivating. The  writing style lends itself to a quick read. De Becker drives home his point  with chilling examples rather than bore the reader to tears with  meaningless psycho babble. It is an excellent commentary on human nature  and the violence that is increasingly permeating into our society.  Definately worth picking up."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This book should be required reading for serious self defense courses, and for professional martial arts teachers.  In my long experience as a practicing martial artist, I have never come across a book, that is so valuable in that it can facilitate the avoidance of danger.  This book will make you feel better.  It is at times scary, but ultimately the reader feels empowered, because with the added information, one can see more options.  I have already given a couple of copies to friends, who have called back with enthusiasm, after they have read it.  The book may be lacking in a couple of areas, but that isn't a loss.  Those areas will be adressed by other books that &quot;The Gift of Fear&quot; will inspire.  I recomend this work to everyone, including people who may need psychological therapy for having a violent disposition, and that would include most of the action stars that fill the screens of our television sets and movie theaters."

The book serves as a great foundation of knowledge for those sincerely interested in self-defense and self-reliance.

As women and girls, we are too often taught to be polite, to not make waves, or to give someone the benefit of the doubt.As a result,we end up ignoring our instincts in an attempt not to appear rude or paranoid. Physical danger or a crime committed against us is the all-to-often result.This book teaches that there is a right and a wrong time for politeness, and that it is never wrong to follow your instincts. I wish I'd read this book decades ago."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Gavin De Becker's book, The Gift of Fear, is such a well written, informative book that it is a shame Mr. De Becker feels he must pander to women in order to sell his book. The opening note of the book is telling of things to come. He states that &quot;when it comes to violence, women can proudly relinquish recognition in the language, because here at least, politically correct would be statistically incorrect.&quot; This statement seems a bit absurd coming from someone whose own mother shot his stepfather. De Becker might want to look at his own use of attempting to be politically correct rather than statistically correct. He certainly chooses to ignore statistics involving the homicide rates in Florida since the concealed carry laws were passed. De Becker states he met a middle-aged couple from Florida who had decided to carry a weapon for protection around the city such as at restaurants, etc. De Becker, in his anti-gun mode (which appears to be his consensus throughout the book) says it would make more sense to carry sharp tubes to give emergency tracheotomies to people who are choking. Yet, he ignores that since the inception of the concealed carry laws, homicide rates in Florida have actually dropped. Carrying his logic through to other instances, one could also say that more children die in swimming pool accidents or from overdosing on iron pills than die from guns, but I certainly don't see the government outlawing vitamins and swimming pools. Really, Mr. De Becker, with all the wonderful insight and advice you give on changing how criminals are viewed in the media, I am surprised that you would fall victim to the same narrow-minded view with regard to gun ownership. You give advice on how to size up someone who might harm you, but you seem to advocate doing nothing or in the case of battered women--going into hiding at a women's shelter. The book seems to suggest that the honorable thing to do is to render oneself defenseless, especially if you are a woman. Yes, it would be nice if there were no guns in America but that would only leave the strong to prey on the weak. Of course, the weak could turn to someone with a gun to help, perhaps the police.

It is unbelievable at how brilliant this book is.		One of the things (but they're many) that really got to me was how Becker really put things in perspective. I'll never ever forget the example of the Antelope in the desert that only \"senses\" danger in a field; You've seen it on the Discovery Channel where the animals head jerks up and out of no where he runs. Then the next minute a lion or panther leaps out of it's hiding spot.		We are the only species that will ignore our built in danger detector because we don't want to come across as \"rude\". We were all raised to treat others with respect and not to come across as rude or uppity; though my experience is based on a upbringing in the south.		So here's my gift to you...		If you read this review and never go get the book always remember this. If ever you are about to get on an elevator or walking in a parking lot and you get just a tad bit of a \"something isn't right\" feeling please turn and walk away. Your conscience will TELL you when something is wrong, LISTEN to it! No matter how silly or ridiculous you may think it is.

I believe that it will be very beneficial to our staff with regard to keeping their intuitive senses sharp. School violence is a topic of critical importance. Our district purchased enough copies to provide every staff person with their own copy. Mr. de Becker uses his experiences to tell us how to keep our senses sharp.

Certainly suggested reading for anyone, professional or otherwise, with a concern or interest in avoiding or predicting violent behavior.  I rank it right up there as required reading along with Massad Ayoob's \"The Truth About Self Protection\" as an industry primer.  There is, however, a noticeable bias, or so it seemed to me, by De Becker against a person's right to self defense, and certainly he has some fairly liberal views as to firearms. I found that odd, in that his perceptive  insights into predicting violent behavior seem to have taken on an almost overly-sympathetic view towards the perpetrator."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Simply stated De Becker is a master at simplifying the often complex and emotion laden analysis of threat situations, especially those involving domestic violence.  His simple matrix ( apparently used by many law enforcement agencies and those dealing with abused women) is well worth the price of the book alone. I have given the book to several women who were faced with  potentially dangerous domestic situations.  In at least one it helped a young mother to see the pattern which motivated her to escape.		His analysis of OJ is enlightening.		On a larger scale it is a good read for any person, especially those who are or will be living in the higher threat urban environment. For those living in isolation it is an abstractly interesting study of the analysis of threats bound together with some interesting stories based on his experience.		DeBecker has a unique combination of personal, professional and educational experiences which make this a quick but great read."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Mr. De Becker is an expert on violent behavior. The author uses case studies of actual crimes, and in most cases the victim felt beforehand that something \"just wasn't quite right\" yet ignored their intuition, with tragic consequences. His interviews with the victims help them recognize the subtle clues they had picked up on subconsciously, how that helped them to survive the attack, and how they can make sense of their intuitive feelings to avoid such crimes in the future. His examinations of how criminals use verbal tactics to manipulate and control, and ways to stop the manipulation in its tracks (forcing them to move on in search of an easier target) are especially enlightening. Before reading \"The Gift of Fear\" I was plagued by a constant sense of unease and worry about the potential for danger as I went about my daily activities. Mr. De Becker's advice helps to cut through the clutter of sensory input and identify which clues should elicit concern.

Being from Europe the scenes seems a bit alien at first but are actually very similar to what goes on over here to.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Western Culture is filled with rationalists who despise superstition and emotionalism, and while we have had great success in applying Reason to science and logic, there is a great danger in making Reason the measure of all things.		In this book, De Backer makes the case that there is another part of our mind that we should listen to besides reason, our survival intuition.  He likens it to a computer program that runs unseen in the background, picking up on details of our environment that we are consciously unaware of, and gives us the instinct of fear when we are in danger.  However, we have become so accustomed to acting only on \"reason\" that we often ignore this legitimate fear because we cannot immediately give a \"rational\" explanation for it.  But the reasons are there, and can be brought to the surface if given time to process the details.  But in the midst of a dangerous situation, there is no time for analysis, only action. And so we ignore this gift of fear to our own detriment.  De Becker argues for listening to and acting upon that fear, and helps the reader sort out what is actual fear as opposed to worry, panic, anxiety, and the like.		I found the book very helpful. De Becker builds his theory first from his own traumatic experience as a child, and then from the experiences of those he as worked with and interviewed during his career as a security consultant. Some of the stories told are disturbing, but perhaps necessary.  Several section of the book tell how to first understand why certain types of people may become violent, and then how to spot and interpret the danger signs.  De Becker argues that all acts of violence are predictable if we pay attention to the danger signs rather than ignoring them.		The only blight I found in the book was the appendix on \"gun safety\", which wasn't about gun safety at all, but a diatribe right out of liberal gun control play book.  He rants about supposedly irresponsible gun manufacturers and gun locks, and uses false analogies and meaningless statistics to leave you with the impression that a firearm is somehow inherently evil, and you can catch \"stray bullets\" in the air much like you can catch the flu. What he neglects to address is the person behind the trigger, for the gun is just a tool controlled by the user.  Perhaps his negative position on firearms (which in retrospect was mingled through the book) was due to his own trauma as a child that involved a firearm.  In any case, the firearm is the most effective tool for self defense, but must be used responsibly, so here's what De Becker should have said about gun safety.		1. Treat every gun as if it were loaded.  Don't ever \"play\" with them, even if you've checked and confirmed that the gun is empty.	2. Keep you finger OFF the trigger until you are ready to fire. People instinctively want to touch the trigger, even when picking a gun up.  Don't touch it.	3. Always point the gun in a safe direction.  Be constantly aware of where a gun is pointing, and do not let the muzzle ever point in an irresponsible direction.	4. When you shoot, be aware of your target and what is behind it.  If you miss, you are responsible for where the bullet goes.	5. Get properly trained.  A gun is not a good luck charm.  You must learn to use it and practice with it.  Take an NRA course and go shooting from time to time."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","As a professional counsellor for thirty years, many of my clients have been victims of domestic violence.  This will be one book that I will be highly recommending to those in need.  The aftermath of a domestic violence scene is a clear, horrific and unforgettable reminder of the physical and emotional damage violence can leave in its wake. The author has given us the reality of violence and outlines ways in which we can best protect ourselves or, in some cases, prevent it.  <p>As De Becker reveals there are a variety of signals which the trained eye can identify that indicate there is a potential threat.  The downside is \"love is blind\" and in many relationships, these early signals go ignored until it is too late.  Violence is not only a crime, it is a need to control and often a result of emotional problems traced back to early childhood.  Some of most notorious violent offenders have presented the outward appearance of being the typical \"nice guy next door.\" <p>The author takes a no-nonsense approach to handing potentially threatening situations.  Many women have, as children, been raised to be well-mannered, polite, and courteous.  As De Becker tells us, these fine qualities do not work when fending off an attacker.  The statistics are:  75 woman are raped every hour and one is beaten every few seconds.  In today's society, a woman needs to have the ability to protect herself as best she can.  As the author reveals, doing what one can to eliminate the potential risk in the first place is an excellent place to start.  I, personally, have training in martial arts and feel any woman would benefit from some form of protection even if it is a short, basic course in self defense.  Having the skills and smarts to best defend yourself may be your one chance for survival if you are ever attacked. <p>The case studies given in this book will likely have a profound impact on the reader.  They are true, documented cases that vividly portray what can and does happen in both your country and mine 365 days of the week, each and every year.  Hopefully, readers will become better prepared to prevent an attack or defend themselves against one.  While the book may place emphasis on women as victims, it should be pointed out that men are also targets of violence and the book could will benefit both genders.  \"The Gift of Fear\" is highly recommended and deserving of far more than five stars in the rating."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I have been recommending \"The Gift of Fear\" since it was first published ten years ago.  As a neuroscientist, psychology and self-defense teacher, and mother, I give it my highest recommendation.		Intuition is not ESP or magic.  Rather, intuition is information that we are sensing that doesn't quite make it to consciousness.  And if it does break the surface of our attention, we have often been socialized to \"talk ourselves out\" of knowing what we know.  We often minimize and rationalize away a true danger as we walk more deeply into a bad situation.		Imagine how much safer we would all be if we allowed ourselves to really listen to those signals and ACT on them.  A teenager on a date -- it is so much safer to draw a boundary at the door at the end of the night, rather than inviting someone in who makes her uncomfortable.  It's common sense, but very hard to do in an actual social situation.  De Becker gets us over that hurdle.		There are two key aspects to De Becker's work: he exposes the tactics that predators use to break down our defenses (typically not physical weapons at first, but social tricks such as implying that we are being rude or bitchy and challenging us to prove otherwise), and he teaches us to listen and act to our perceptions of true fear.		The good news is that once you sharpen your intuitive skills, you can actually say goodbye to the constant \"static noise\" of free-floating worry and anxiety, knowing that if there is something you need to pay attention to, you will hear that signal like a clear bell and act on it."

Gavin de Becker is the nation's leading expert on predicting violent behavior and he continues to lead the way in his field of study.		The beauty of the Gift of Fear is that we all have \"intuition\" and \"gut feelings\", it is what we do with these feeling that can determine whether the outcome is tragic or uneventful. The book teaches you to never ignore such feelings and that our intuition is an early warning sign that something IS wrong. Human beings are the only creature on the planet that will ignore this sense and oftentimes it leads to tragic outcomes. The beauty is that you don't need to buy a gadget to tap into this resource...you are born with it and all you have to do is listen to it and acknowledge it. Our world is filled with signals of danger yet many, if not most, people go about their business with a complete lack of situational awareness. Oftentimes these people present themselves as optimal targets by looking down at the ground when they walk, shoulders slumped, avoiding eye contact, etc. We have people completely oblivious who are walking around listening to their MP3 player, iPod, or talking on their cell phones. All of these distractions make such individuals inviting targets for the predators in society. Having situational awareness to know what is going on in your environment allows your intuition to provide you an early warning signal that something is wrong which in turn allows you to acknowledge the feeling and then ACT accordingly. The Gift of Fear will provide you will the necessary information to act accordingly. Buy this book, read it and then make your loved ones read it! Yes, it is that valuable."

Every person can relate to this book in some manner of their lives, be it in a personal relationship, tragedy, or work related. I was recommended this book by a long lost friend that I became reacquainted with after a decade of abuse. After reading this heart touching book on a personal note, I found that what I went through could have been prevented if I would have read this several years ago and learned the survival information this book has taught me. I no longer call it a book, I call it a guide. Thank you to Gavin DeBecker for taking your knowledge and putting it out there for the rest of the world to read and learn from.

Yes, it's subject matter is confronting and one we'd all rather not have to deal with. But the reality is exactly the opposite. EVERY single person on the planet will be affected by violence at some point in their life. If not themselves, someone they work with or live with or care about. What is so incredible about this book is that whilst the subject matter is about violence, it really is actually a manual of discovering more abilities we possess as human beings that we never knew we had!! This book was like someone telling me I had an extra set of arms at my disposal that I was blindly unaware of! This book is about being more human and ironically it sits proudly on the same shelf as any of my best personal development books i own.		I grew as a person by reading this book. I have shared this with family and friends and they too have told of how it has transformed them for the better.		If you have never read this book then please just do it now. It is guaranteed to radically change the way you see yourself, the world and everyone else in it; sometimes for a little worse .. but ultimately for the best."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","\"The Gift of Fear\" makes a great case for the value of having, listening to, and acting on intuition.  It also helps explain why many people in Western societies endanger themselves by choosing logic over intuition.  We reason away the messages that our complex, near-instantaneous preservation system send us, choosing instead to avoid conflict or be nice when confronted with people who are dangerous.  The book includes several eye-opening statistics about violence against women in the United States, including the fact that the most frequent cause of on-the-job death for women is being killed by a coworker.		Would take off half a star for the self-promotion angle; the author markets himself and his company's products throughout the book.  Nevertheless, the idea the book MOST promotes is that we can and should take advantage of the gift of intuition--which includes the gift of fear--and live relaxed and confident in the knowledge that it will protect us.  I completely understood, after reading the book, why advice columnist Carolyn Hax recommends it to any letter writers who are uneasy about the possibility of violence in a relationship."

After reading the critic's reviews I see that it wouldn't serve much purpose.		To the degree that this book alerts unaware people as to how to carry themselves safely in this world I applaud it.  To the degree this book contributes to the growing hysteria over 'safety' as promulgated by the lunatic right fringe (yes, including President Bush) I condemn it.  Smacks of McCarthyism and the Red Scare all over again.		The last reader's review sparked my ire.  She stated something to the effect of \"I was plagued by a constant sense of unease and worry about the potential for danger as I went about my daily activities\".  That being the case I would suggest a shrink, not a book that will further enable your fantasies.		Also, absurdisms such as \"no man unknown to you has a reason to stop and ask directions\".  Huh?  I happen to be a man who routinely asks people I don't know directions, man or woman....I could care less.  And now this gets one branded as a potentially dangerous person.  Let's see, men are criticized for NOT asking directions, and now they are set up as suspicious FOR asking directions.  Why not just title the book \"Men Are Dangerous and To Be Avoided\"?

I also see parallels with the current war on Islamists. Our President's persistent argument that we're facing \"evildoers\" while ignoring their motivations and not even attempting to understand them is exactly what most people do when faced with every day threats of the kind discussed in this book."

Give the guy a break; don't judge people (or don't judge books by their covers); don't be an elitist, etc.  The author here simply points out that it doesn't matter what pure or neutral rationalizations you force through your brain, since you can still be raped, robbed or beaten, or worse, right in the middle of your upbeat thought.  His point here reminded me of the community activist on the West Side of Chicago who was killed with a pipe to the head by some punk who never knew that this woman had for over 20 years worked as a reconciliation advocate in her changing community--as he spied her walking along in a vulnerable position, and then demanded her purse.  His perspective on her was more decisive.  Should she have been more careful?  Or was she paying the price of unconditional love and acceptance toward her neighbors?  <p>This is a good message for, e.g., the high school girls who blithely suggest that they be dropped off at the store, to walk the mile home at 10:00 pm, not realizing how they will look to some criminal in that situation.  &quot;But I don't feel scared&quot; they will protest.  &quot;Hey, it doesn't matter how you feel.&quot;  <p>This book counsels that we listen to our adult intuition, and that we help our kids develop theirs.  It's a good argument for looking to things like PADS, or other organizations, to channel our concern for the poor and homeless, and to control their access to our daughters and property.  Nothing mean spirited or discriminatory about that, not when we calculate the millions of years of life that criminals deprive us of each year by their activity."

Logic is more likely to get people into trouble by adding unnecessary complexity to the decision making process.  Intuition, my friends, is the key to freeing yourself from fear.		Example 1: We meet somebody we have not seen for a while and we know something about their physical appearance has changed, but we can't tell exactly what.  They could have changed their hair color or fames of their glasses?  Our intuition never goes on vacation and is NEVER wrong		Example 2:  A man walks up to you and asks for directions.  He doesn't have the outward appearance of a man who is lost and your intuition says \"stay alert--this guy may be up to something.\"  Later, you find out that the man was in fact lost, and that he looked relaxed because he used to live in the area.  He was looking for a building that wasn't there when he left town.  The man did not give off the signals of a typically lost person because he was on familiar ground.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Why do some people live a life full of pain and suffering that they can never escape from while others live a life of peace and happiness, never experiencing tragedy? The two can live next door to each other, work similar jobs, have similar hobbies and yet live in two totally different worlds.		It's easy to say that one of them is lucky and the other unlucky - that some people are just dealt bad cards - but this kind of answer is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to absolve ourselves of responsibility for our own lives while allowing us to remain politically correct by not blaming the \"unfortunate\" for their undesirable predicaments.		The real reason for the difference between two otherwise similar people is that one of them understands the world and one of them does not. One of them is unable to see the signs screaming \"Danger!\" while the other sees it from a mile away. One of them is in touch with their intuition and the other is not.		That's right - it's not intelligence that makes the difference when it comes to safety, it's intuition. If intelligence were the critical ingredient then only unintelligent people would be victims of crime: smart people would see through the charade and avoid the danger, but that's not how it works. Instead, it's the un-instinctive people that become victims because their intellect and reason were not enough to show them the difference between a nice man walking in the same direction as them and a \"nice\" man following them home.		People with good instincts are victims less often and this book, more than any other I've read, aims to get you in touch with the intuition, the instinct - the gift of fear - that saves lives and that makes life better lived. Through many personal anecdotes GdB reveals the true nature of human interactions in a very understandable and easily digested format. This book doesn't read like a manual on human psychology at all, but that's exactly what it is. This is human behavior explained humanely."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I am a law enforcement officer and have worked the streets in the Southern California area for almost 20 years. I read this book and would NOT recommend it to anyone. I have the 1997 edition and it was given to my by a friend to read and review.		First, the book promotes an anti-gun bias and the author wastes no time in alleged gun violence statistics he provides but interestingly never cites his sources to support them. Here's an example, \"In the last two years alone, more Americans died from gunshot wounds than were killed during the entire Vietnam War.\"		De Becker never cited which last two years so I assumed it was the years 1995 and 1996.  Per Wikipedia, 58,209 brave American soldiers were killed in the Vietnam War, 153,303 wounded and 1,948 missing. I checked FBI crime statistics under the combined category of murder/non-negligent manslaughter rates for the years of 1995 and 1996. In 1995, there were 21,665 murders and in 1996 there were 19,645 murders for a total of 41,310 well short of 58,209 soldiers killed in the Vietnam War.		He further compares United States crime rate to Japan's crime rate. A nation of over 260 million (1995 statistics) versus a nation of 126 million(1995 statistics)is not a fair comparison. Is Japan a safe country? Not really, as you are more likely to commit suicide in Japan. Japan's murder rate average 0.9 per 100,000, but its suicide rate is 20.3, for a combined rate of 21.1 per 100,000.  The U.S. murder rate average 7.4 per 100,000, and the suicide rate is 12.0, for a combined total of 19.4 per 100,000. Thus, the combined murder and suicide rates in Japan and the U.S. are nearly equal even though firearms are virtually non-existent in Japan.		He then claims, \"By this time tomorrow, 400 more Americans will suffer a shooting injury and another 1,100 will face a criminal with a gun as Kelly did. Within the hour, another 75 women will be raped as Kelly was.\"		I tried finding statistics for the above quote but could not find any data that supported his claim. What I did find was that Prof. Gary Kleck from the School of Criminology, Florida State University, discovered Americans use firearms to prevent crimes approximately 1 to 1.5 million times per year. These are the very cases De Becker ignored. Had De Becker considered these facts, he would have had to conclude a firearm in the home makes a family and a person safer.		Prof. Kleck also discovered that robbery victims who defended themselves with a gun suffered lower rates of injury than did those who resisted without a gun, or even those who did not resist at all and instead complied with the violent criminal's demands. In short, Prof. Kleck concluded the private ownership of firearms deters criminal behavior. (Source: \"Crime Control Through the Private Use of Armed Force\" by Gary Kleck		Here's another fabulous claim by De Becker.\" In (sad) fact, if a full jumbo jet crashed into a mountain killing everyone on board and that happened every month, month in and month out, the number of people killed still wouldn't equal the number of women murdered by their husbands and boyfriends each year.		Per Wikipedia, the Boeing 747 is commonly nicknamed the \"Jumbo Jet and depending on layout can hold between 417 and 524 passengers. I did not include the flight crew. Let us do some math. 417 x 12=5004 and 524 x12=6288. Now according to De Becker 417 to 524 plus women are murdered each month by their intimates.		In 1996, approximately 1,800 murders in the US were attributed to intimates; nearly three out of four of these (1,326) had a female victim the rest were male victims! (Bureau of Justice Statistics) Now 1326 divided in 12 is 110.5. Not the 417 to 524 plus murders De Becker claims to occur monthly.		De Becker is alleged to be a security expert but I could not find anything on his training and experience as a 'security expert.\" What makes him a security expert? I found his bio on the Internet and it cites his awards but nothing on his background, training or expertise. I could only find that he now resides in Fiji with seven adopted children. I guess he's so scared that he left the United States. I would like to know how many hardened criminals the author has arrested,confronted or fought in his lifetime.		I was very disappointed that a highly regarded author and \"security expert\" distorted facts and failed miserably in citing any sources for his alleged facts in his book.  What else did he distort in his book? He sets the reader up(especially women) to be in fear then offers his solution to the reader to rely on your \"gift of fear\" or your inner self or gut feelings. This book provides the reader with a false sense of security. If you want to protect yourself you better learn how to fight with and without a weapon.		In my opinion, this book is for the gullible and the fearful. It provides the reader with no alternative but to rely on the alleged gift of fear or intuition to protect you. Fear is not a gift and will get you killed. If you are in a state of fear, your body will shutdown and you will not be able to fight back. You should always know your surroundings and rely on common sense. You should also train your body and mind for physical combat. Seek out experts in firearms instruction and in the combat arts. Always fight back and never give up! Which martial art should you study? For the beginner, I would suggest the Israeli martial art of Krav Maga as it provides the student with a combat mindset.		Here's a true life story. In the early 1990's, I took a criminal report for a young female school teacher in which her former boyfriend threatened to kill her. She had obtained a restraining order against him but it did little to stop his ongoing verbal threats. Her boyfriend was arrested several times but was released within a few hours. This kept him away for a time but did not stop the verbal threats. She was very concerned that he was going to kill her and that nothing was going to stop him. She lived alone in a rural area and asked me if she should buy a handgun. I told her yes but only if she obtained firearms training. I introduced her to a fellow officer that worked weekends as a certified firearms instructor at a private range. She immediately received firearms training that weekend from that officer, purchased a handgun, and became very proficient with her handgun (women tend to be excellent shooters). About two months later, her boyfriend was back at her home armed with a knife, she grabbed her 9mm handgun and escaped through the rear door of her home.  He broke into her home and went after her. He was about 50 yards away threatening to kill her when she took a defensive posture, pointed her handgun at him and told him to stop. He refused and ran towards her with the knife in his hand. In self defense, she fired about four shots at him and killed him. This was an unfortunate incident that the young lady had to go through but she used common sense and training to protect herself.  She was not arrested and the local prosecutor determined that she acted in self-defense. She trained her body and mind for combat and it saved her life. I am glad that I had a very small part in saving that young lady's life.  Remember: The Gift of FEAR=False Evidence Appears Real.		For those of us that believe in the Almighty God, here's a scripture to remember. \"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.) 2 Timothy 1:7"
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This book was recommended to me by a friend, after an incident that happened when I was traveling. I went into a gas station while my husband was pumping gas outside, and was approached by a man who, I would have thought, shouldn't have caused me even a moment's concern -- and yet, I was instantly extremely afraid. I left the store immediately, without buying a soda (as I had intended) and without speaking to the man, who tried several ways to engage me in conversation.		My husband thought I was being silly, but honestly, I've never felt that way before, and it unsettled me. This book helped explain why I felt the way I did -- although I lack de Becker's skill at working backward through my unconscious to identify what exactly it was that I recognized as *wrong* in that situation, I do believe that I was correct, and that the man posed some threat to me. I now have a lot more faith in my intuition, and my ability to identify truly dangerous situations accurately.		Every woman (and maybe every man) should read this book. I intend to have my older daughter read it before she goes to college; it is probably the best book on personal safety I have ever read."

And to not have to \"keep your enemies close\".  I would recommend anyone to read this even if you do not have an antagonistic situation at present.  It can give you what you need to make sure you do not give your power away and if for some reason you do how to recapture it.  There are great tools and examples of how to read where a person is in \"running their tapes\".  And you can know when things are about to accelerate before they actually do.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I am a multiple incident PTSD survivor; I have anxiety, panic, depression - you name it. So when I saw Gavin DeBecker's book entitled \"The Gift of Fear\" I immediately thought, \"when can fear ever be a gift.? \" I live in a hyper-vigilant state from my life experiences so the book title appeared to be an oxy-moron; I've NEVER felt my fear to be a gift, but rather a very heavy and sometimes debilitating burden. However DeBecker's book was utterly eye-opening. I literally couldn't put it down. He gives great examples of what true fear is as compared with the wasted energy spent on worry and anxiety. DeBecker gives solid reasoning for trusting your intuition and also provides many true stories of violent behavior that may have been avoided  if only people could learn to trust their precious gift of instinct/intuition. It seems that almost every example that was presented as the subject of a violent crime, the victim describes an uncomfortable/uneasy feeling right before the actual crime. Intuition is our bodies' natural warning signal honed over years of evolution; some of us have forgotten how to use it, or all too often we dismiss the feeling altogether. DeBecker's book gave me hope for the future by describing tools to use to recognize true fear from worry and anxiety. Neither worry nor anxiety are helpful to our goal of safety,in fact they can have long lasting effects on our overall health and well being and actually interfere with our internal \"warning system\". This is a must read for everyone that wants to know more about learning to identify real intuition, and finding ways to reduce/eliminate the time-wasting and unhealthy habits of worry and anxiety. His book is interesting and well written; he's definitely a leading expert in predicting violent behavior for his high profile clients that engage his services  and in his book he shares that knowledge with the rest of us. I really could not put this book down; I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to understand violence and how each of us can take an active role in not becoming a victim if  we can just learn to trust our intuition and learn the warning signs that can predict violent behavior. I really  loved this book even though I was skeptical - it was a pleasant surprise and it's a book that won't disappoint."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","A highly readable book that made many fictions look rather boring.  You won't waste your money for a good weekend's enjoyment even if you don't follow through with the advice.  The gist of the book is not very complicated, though, to be of more practical use, one has to go beyond this book (which for corporations or high-net-worth folks mean buying the services of Gavin de Becker Incorporated). Gavin's more important lessons can be summarized below:		1. Make use of fear (intuition) to act rather than to worry (last chapter: The Gift of Fear), though easier said than done.		2. Act promptly and quickly based on \"evidence\" provided by one's instinct/intuition/unconscious (page 182: They told us, \"Just because a man beats his wife doesn't mean he killed her,\" and that's true. But what's that got to do with O.J. Simpson, who beat his wife, broke into her home, threatened her (at least once with a gun), terrorized her, and stalked her?  That behavior puts him very near the center of the predictive circle for wife murder).  As a professional services provider, Becker's attitude is better play safe, and act on predictive factors rather than wait for more evidence.		3. Better to stay away (or steer away) from direct confrontation with the would-be dangerous suspect. His rationale is that it is more important to prevent disaster than try to change the behavior of the suspect.  Again as a professional services provider, saving his clients is definitely more important than changing the personality of the subject (who won't pay anyway!)		4. In relation to (3) above, Gavin did justified his recommendation by saying that it would normally be quite impossible for the victim to change the personality of one who uses violence against him or her.  Page 189 reads, \"When men in these situations do not find out what is going on inside them, when they do not get counseling or therapy, it is a choice to continue using violence.  Such men are taking the risk that violence will escalate to homicide, for as Carl Jung said, 'When an inner situation is not made conscious, it appears outside as fate'\".  Corollary: counseling or therapy to the violent guy should be done ASAP if at all possible or feasible.		5. Finally, in actual violence situation, Gavin certainly advised one to train to be physically prepared to defend oneself.  He advised against spending years training martial arts in a dojo (that incidentally trained one NOT to harm his/her opponent during training sessions), rather he advised doing full-contact self-defense training using padded instructors who pose assailants, well, using \"the gift of fear\" (or \"the powerful wish to survive\") to drill the victim to use all his/her power to (brutally) attack and end the dangerous situation in his/her favor within minutes.		All in all, the book gives good advice for all of us who are interested in the art of survival without fear."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","As the author points out, there are (usually) warning signs indicating that a violent event may occur.  Arguably, teaching someone to recognize these signs (or 'trust their gut' if you will) may save his/her life one day.  From that perspective, what do you have to lose (besides, well...).  In fact, the premise of this work actually forms the foundation of several 'defensive response' training programs across the country (such as police training).		Clearly, learning to recognize potential threats and respond rationally is certainly a valuable technique...one worthy of a book exploring this process.  Of course, there are always those rare people who instinctively respond to threats in the \"appropriate manner\"; for everyone else, there is \"The Gift of Fear.\")"

It only generates  needless worry and gives one a distorted view of the world.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","When a young relative of mine was vacationing, a stranger grabbed her by the arm and said, \"Come with me or I'll kill you.\" She reacted instinctively and broke free, and as she ran she expected to be shot at any second. But she made it to safety and provided the cops with a good description.		One year later and 100 miles from where that happened, another little girl was grabbed by a stranger, who said something to her--this was captured on videotape. The frightened child, instead of fleeing, cooperated. She was later murdered by her abductor.		I think most of us fall into that second category, because we don't listen to the instinct to run, or to fight, or to (best of all) avoid those situations in the first place. We've been trained to suppress those very instincts that exist to preserve our lives.		What deBecker's book so expertly does is re-train us to listen to our intuition, to scope out our environment and everyone in it, and to read the danger signs we would otherwise prefer to ignore.		Panic and anxiety are not useful emotions; fear is different. Fear is what compels us to take action if there is a clear and present danger; it's what allows us to see what's happening and respond appropriately. It's an emotion that should be nurtured instead of conquered.  We don't want our kids to grow up afraid of the boogeyman, scared to go out of their homes or try new things or meet new people. De becker teaches us that, instead, if we develop and learn to trust our intuition, we can free ourselves from that trap, just as we can react positively if we are ever in a position that requires immediate escape.		He shows, with examples and self-reflective exercises, what to ask yourself, and what to do, if you have a \"gut feeling\" that tells you something is wrong.		Parents, children and women especially need this skill.		It's great to learn self-defense, to build your confidence in what you can physically do to protect yourself. But that ability is enhanced by the lessons in this book.  And sometimes, being a black-belt is irrelevent to dangers that are out there.		DeBecker's best lessons are learning how to listen to yourself, how to interpret warning signs from dangerous people, and teaching us how to predict behavior. You don't have to be \"surprised\" by someone's crazy or hostile actions if you can see them coming and cut them off at the pass. He points out that every time we get behind the wheel of a car, we're predicting what every other driver on the road will do. All we have to learn is how to apply that knowledge to a boyfriend who won't take no for an answer, a neighbor who takes a creepy interest in our kid, or a job applicant who is a little too persistent.		DeBecker says some things that will rub people the wrong way--such as, for battered partners: the first time it happens, you're a victim and the second time, you're a volunteer. But that's actually true. If you KNOW what this person is going to do, and you choose to stay in the relationship in spite of this information, then you have to own the consequences.		The appendices are useful and the reading list is also a good resource, but the IMPACT self-defense classes deBecker recommends are not available everywhere. I wish the book gave a little more information about choosing a self-defense course if IMPACT is not in the area."

Repeatedly discounting the word \"no\", even in small matters; typecasting; attempted loansharking; deceptive and self-serving charm; and unwarranted persistence were all warning signs of a bad dating situation.	 The chapter \"I was trying to let him down easy\" provides an effective method to end a no-win situation quickly and without guilt. The strategy: Tell him explicitly that you have decided to not go out with him again. (Do not use the word \"date\"; he may counter-offer and suggest \"going out as friends\" instead. Then you are still stuck with him.) Do not offer reasons why. Do not negotiate. Your reasons are your business; his only interest is in your final decision. Cease contact, and do not respond to any attempted contact by him.	 This technique may appear cold; certainly, it isn't warranted in every breakup. Recognize, though, that manipulators have honed a strategy that advances their interests with little regard to your well-being. Don't feel sorry for them. They know what they are doing.

Human beings have an enormous capacity to reach deep inside and access the powers within.  We just choose not to.  Whether it is a religious belief that makes us look outside of ourself for help or just conditioning, we have let this gift atrophy.  I always said the answer to so many of our problems is in the listening, not the doing or talking.  Just sit quietly and listen, the answers are all there if you're willing to allow them to surface.	DeBecker knows this and teaches you how to hone these skills. He will show you how to trust yourself, have faith in your own ability to know when a situation is terribly wrong.	How many of us suddenly see all the red flags at the end of a horrible relationship or situation?  Those red flags did not suddenly appear out of nowhere.  They were there from the beginning and were ignored or pushed aside either out of ignorance or the desire for the \"appearance\" of a situation.  The great guy, the independence, the can't miss business opportunity.  All of these  can shout decibels louder than your intuition ever could.  Intuition is quiet voice, it has to be actively listened too, it won't overpower any voice you choose to hear.  \"The Gift of Fear\" will help you listen to yourself, to hear what is inside you.	This is the best gift you can give your teenagers, help them learn this from the start. I might even go as far as to say no better graduation gift exists.  Okay, so put it on the seat of that new car or put the cash inside the pages instead of a card, but do give this as a gift to the ones you love.  It very well might save their lives.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Gavin de Becker has produced a landmark work in the dual fields of criminal psychology and self defense. I was recommended \"The Gift of Fear\" by a colleague with experience in law enforcement: he claimed it was the best overall book on self preservation and personal safety he had ever read, and while it is excellent for both sexes, it is especially valuable for women. I purchased the book for a female friend on his recommendation, and I read it as well. The book is detailed, personal, practical, and poignant.		The book extols the value of intuition (and resultant fear) as a predictor of potential violent or harmful behavior. Although my original intent in purchasing the book was a concern about violence from outsiders, the area of the book that I believe is most useful (especially to women) is violence from intimate partners. I found the sections on predicting violent behavior from people known to a victim to be the most harrowing yet most practical in the book. One thing that runs as a theme through the book (again, especially useful to women) is that controlling behavior in any relationship is an extremely serious warning. Although most controlling males don't become violent, the likelihood of violence from them is dramatically higher than in a healthy relationship; further, even if the scenarios don't escalate to violence, control issues can manifest themselves in a variety of other awful ways that are only touched on here.		In this book de Becker makes the case that intuition is actually reasoned, but it is a function performed so fast in our brains that we are unaware exactly why we have such feelings. I think the book argues persuasively that we ignore such warnings at our own risk and that while we may be more comfortable with reason and logic, intuition is an invaluable ally, as is genuine fear (which is altogether different from worry or anxiety.)		Although I bought this book for a very close friend for a very specific reason, I am going to purchase several more copies for other people I love and care about. Rarely do I recommend a self-help book unequivocally, but this is one of those times. Buy this book, read it yourself, and pass it along to people you love.		This is a fantastic book, and I wholeheartedly endorse it."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","THE GIFT OF FEAR: AND OTHER SURVIVAL SIGNALS THAT PROTECT US FROM VIOLENCE by Gavin de Becker is a helpful, engaging quick read (it's a trade paperback of around 380 pages). His premise is that fear is a means of survival and that if we listen to it and follow it, we can save our own and others' lives; however, for various reasons, we often discount our intuition about danger or we don't listen to our fear and put ourselves unnecessarily at risk.<p>The book begins with a &quot;true crime&quot; story about Kelly, a woman who was raped in her apartment by a man she met in her stairwell who offered to carry the groceries she had dropped up to her apartment. De Becker parses the incident and categorizes the methods the attacker employed to get her to do what he wanted and put herself under his control, and this section is very enlightening. But the main theme of this first chapter and the book is that men and women should follow their intuition -- intuition isn't some flighty, sixth sense; it's a call to action when your brain has become aware of many small signs that something isn't right, even if, at that moment, you cannot articulate exactly what is wrong.<p>This book is not a self-defense or how-to guide, but rather makes a case for intuition and believing in oneself when one senses danger or feels fear, and the best reading in it, I think, is the examples de Becker explicates from his many years in the security and risk-assessment business (he also lived through an exceedingly violent and abusive childhood). The chapters address being in the presence of danger, how intuition works and functions, the science of violence predictors, survival signals, violent crime from strangers, high-stakes predictions, understanding threats to kill, dealing with too-persistent people, violence in the workplace, domestic violence, dating abuses and violence, violent children, public figure attacks and pursuits and extreme cases.<p>I found several things particularly interesting and engaging about this book. First, de Becker states emphatically throughout the work that violence is predictable, and that no one ever &quot;just snaps&quot; or is just an inexplicably bad person. Second, his predictor of violence is a useful tool -- and I would think may be applicable in other assessment situations -- to make informed judgments on risk. Third, I got a great deal personally out of his comparisons of worry and anxiety with fear in which he suggest that the first two are destructive and distracting (and may prevent someone from spotting real danger signs), but that fear is what has saved many, many lives and could save your own. Fourth, his writing on people who are too persistent is very interesting, and he shows how people's attempts to deal with stalkers is often just going to keep the situation alive.<p>Finally, the chapter on domestic violence was absolutely fascinating, primarily because this is a man who deals in truth and reality, not romance and excuses. He states that when assessing relationships, women often make judgments based on potential rather than on the present situation, which causes them to ignore warning signs and predictive incidents. He also says that he is in the business of safety, not justice, and that because of that he isn't a supporter of restraining orders in all cases because in some, they aggravate the offender more and can actually be a precipitating incident toward murder or its attempt.<p>Toward the beginning of the book, de Becker writes about how men don't really understand the risk under which women constantly live, but that for women personal safety is a constant consideration. He writes, &quot;Men are worried that women will laugh at them.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I was stalked at work a few years back by another employee.  And I've had run-ins with stalkers before:  my college room-mate was stalked and he tried to break into the apartment while I was there with her, and my good friend was stalked and murdered by her estranged husband (who committed suicide later) - the cops called me 20 minutes after she passed seeking next-to-kin that weren't her kids.		I knew I had to get help now to stop this, I was going to be proactive.  But my boss didn't want to be involved and wasn't much help.		So I went to the police for help.  A female officer recommended this book to me, and said it has very good advice and to internalize it.		She was so right!  I read it twice, I read passages out loud, and I followed the advice.  I've moved on and away from the guy.		This book is great, and should be a required read for book clubs and high-schoolers."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","The book is not an easy one to read. The subject is real, the examples are deeply difficult, but the truth in it will, as they say, set you free. You'll find yourself growing stronger and stronger with each chapter. On the very last page, at the very last period, you'll close the book and realize that you are a completely different person than the one who began it.		I read The Gift of Fear in 1994 only because my friend gave me her copy. It's a book title, cover, and topic I would normally stay far from. But my friend is the calm and well-grounded type and had never before recommended a book to me. The offer seemed helpful, I gave it a chance, and it was.		Although more than a decade has passed since I read it, some very concrete examples remain with me, including:		1) You have amazing instincts when it comes to danger. Does a stranger say \"I promise\" in order to get you to do something? This inappropriate use of the phrase is an immediate trigger that something is wrong. Gavin will show you what your instincts are, why they are, and how they help.		2) There is a difference between fear that is the result of something likely and fear that is not. For instance, people who keep guns at home due to fear of break-ins are actually more likely to see family members shot. And people are less likely to fear more probable risks, such as automobiles and being obese.		3) Panic comes when you've got time to think. It often happens seconds, hours, or days later, but not really during the moment of the incident itself, when you're in the moment, and powered by adrenaline, instinct, and intuition.		4) If you're a victim of physical violence, don't blame yourself. In some of the examples in the book, it's only because of the victim's actions that she survived at all. Instead, thank yourself for overcoming the situation and think about how you did it.		The book is filled with similarly compelling information, useful for any mature individual. So, if you're in mind to listen to a suggestion today--in what I hope is a calm and well-grounded way--I propose that you consider reading Gavin de Becker's powerful book, The Gift of Fear. And then pass it along to someone else."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Awesome book - read it a few years ago and still think every woman, mother, father should read this - every child should be raised with such encouragement and self-awareness."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","De Becker's book is an interesting introduction to a topic that we rarely give critical thought to, namely our survival instincts, fear, and ways of coping with dangerous situations that most Americans are likely to face.  The dangers that De Becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities (i.e. stalking, rape), but he also talks about robberies, teen suicides/murders, intra-family crimes of violence, etc.  He repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people's past behavior, as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them.  My main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm, which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone.  Nevertheless I recommend the book, especially for younger and middle aged women."

The author combines real life accounts with detailed information on why and how people attack others.

I'll be giving more of these as gifts to cousins & friends' children as they grow up."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","That's the central message of the book, and one that may save your life if you listen to it.		Through this book, de Becker has convinced me that most violence can be predicted. He goes through a great many common situations in which violence happens in the U.S., from encounters with strangers, workplace violence to domestic violence and date stalking. In each situation, he describes the indicators of likely violence. Some of these indicators are so often overlooked and rationalized away by the people involved. My favorite one is called: \"Refusal to take no for an answer.\" It can be as trivial as the new date persisting in offering you a drink. Although trivial, such incidents are very telling about his tendency toward violence.		De Becker also discusses a characteristic in many people that blunts out their intuition to actual dangers: unwarranted anxiety. Due to media and social conditioning and other influences, those people feel fear or anxiety in situations that do not pose actual dangers. Such unwarranted anxiety makes them confused and oblivious to the real signals from their intuition. De Becker offers ways for people to overcome that curse and live a life relatively free from fear and anxiety.		In short, I would highly recommend this book. It is one of the few books should be read by everyone (both men and women)."

But after reading this book, I should be able to foresee a potential threat and be able to react proactively to protect myself and loved ones.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This is a great book and I recommend it to all my friends, but I do like to give them a little information first.		First of all, the author is a security specialist for rich and famous people, so he spends his days listening to threats and analyzing threatening situations.  All the info in the book comes from experiences of clients he's worked with.  He designed the MOSAIC Threat Assessment Systems used to screen threats to Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, members of United States Congress, and senior officials of the Central Intelligence Agency.  The guy certainly knows what he's talking about.		Second, you don't know me at all.  And I know my sister was never as paranoid as me so when she said the book isn't scary, I did not think that would apply to me.  I don't know if that makes sense.  Basically a lot of people don't have problems with things (i.e. CSI) that make it difficult for me to function in the dark :).  So embarrassing as it is, I want you to know that I don't shower when no one else is home, that I get nervous when there is an unexpected knock at the door (yes even in the day), and I usually run up the stairs at night even though I've just been down there and know no one is hiding in the dark.  BUT I used to be that and worse.		Third, when I say that the book is not scary, it does come with a caveat.  The first story of the whole book is indeed scary.  (To make it short, girl lets someone come into her apartment, he rapes her, then says he is leaving but she knows he is going to kill her and she wraps the sheet around her and walks right past him in the kitchen out the door and into her neighbors house.)  But then he picks apart the situation to show how she could have avoided being a victim, and also discusses the difference between paranoia (like I was, looking for people behind parked cars and such) and real fear that drives action (like her walking right past the bad guy out of the apartment when he could have turned around and seen her there at any minute).  The rest of the examples in the book really didn't scare me, and even that one in the end helped me have confidence that if I get in a bad situation I may be able to survive.		Fourth, this book is full of information that really makes you think.  And while it isn't scary, I postponed reading it so long that I had to read it in two days to get it back to my sister in time.  And that was a little overwhelming.  I would recommend reading a chapter at a time and then waiting a day or so to have time to absorb and reflect.  Although I have a friend who just couldn't put it down even though I told her that, and she didn't mind reading it all in three sittings.		Anyway just info I think is helpful.  I really do think all women should read this book.  And I'm not over-exaggerating when I say I think it has changed my life.  I am way less stressed, anxious and paranoid.  Not that I'm not careful.  I'm just not scared now of things that I don't need to be."

That's great, so the real question is, \"If I don't want to get mugged, and I ideally I shouldn't use karate, what the heck should I use?!\"		The answer is in this book.		Simply put: Learn to use your instincts, to sharpen your awareness of your own fear, to recognize real potential danger, and to avoid it.		The book is easy to understand, it dives into the psychology of fear without swamping the reader with jargon, and it uses many anecdotes to explain the right and wrong ways people handle dangerous situations. There's more to it than simply avoiding all dark alleys or considering yourself entirely safe because you carry pepper spray. The book empowers the reader, it's better than any self-defense course, and it requires less of a time commitment."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","First of all, I must tell you I have read this book twice, but my daughter has read it 7, yes seven, times.  She has worn it out and I have replaced it 4 times.  She can quote most of it directly and is now one of the most forthright and aware people I know.  I have bought 11 copies of this book.  4 for her and one for my other daughter and one for each of my daughters-in-law and for my 2 best friends. Of course I have 2 myself.  I honestly believe it is a MUST READ for every woman, mother, and daughter.  There is not a woman (or man for that matter) that would not benifit from this book.  Even if that benifit is just being more aware of your surroundings.  That alone, could avoid a possible confrontation or worse.  Besides the copies I have personally purchased, I can't begin to tell you how many women I have encouraged to read this book. After reading it, every one of them reported feeling safer and some acknowledged an experience, in which they believe, information gleaned from this reading helped them avert a potentially risky and/or dangerous situation.  Please, please buy it, check it out at the library or borrow it from a friend, but read it (at least once).  It can't hurt and it could \"save your life\"."

Another writer recommended the book to me, and I'm glad she did, not only because it helps me to deepen my characters, but also because it helps me to help other women.		This is not to say that the book is addressed solely to women. Far from it. Men will benefit from its analysis of trained intuition and may learn to trust their own.		Highly recommended reading."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I liked this book a lot, not just because of the author's insights, but because it confronts and distinguishes between fear, anxiety, worry, perception, and gut instinct.  All are important, but anxiety and worry are destructive.  This book tells how to unshackle yourself from these destructive behaviors, and how to harness the constructive gifts of fear, perception, and instinct.		As a woman who has taken a whole lot of self defense classes (both psychololgically and physically based), I can tell you one thing they all share with this book:  Don't act like a victim.  If you act cowed- walking with head down, hood up, and keys out- you look like a good target.  Predators attack those that appear weak.  This book explains how regain confidence by listening to yourself, which in turn becomes a doubly protective mechanism.		In closing, I read through the one star reviews, and they all seem to have an axe to grind because DeBecker doesn't advocate owning a gun as a means of protection.  While I don't think this makes the author anti-gun, I do think it's important for people like me, who are NOT comfortable owning a gun, to have resources other than, \"buy a handgun and learn to shoot it\".  That, after all, would make an awfully short and (for me at least) unuseful book."

I'm not sure how many years ago I read the print version but it is as I say, the best self help book, ever. I was involved in the security consulting and investigation business for many years and have had a number of instances where I have referred clients or acquaintances who have been or felt threatened by spouses or co-workers to this publication. A friend and business associate is the executive in charge of security for a multi-plant and multi-jurisdictional business. After giving him my own copy to read, he felt that it is such a valuable resource that he keeps a number of copies available at any time in the event that an employee comes to him with an issue of abuse or harassment. He gives immediate counsel to the employee doing everything he can to ensure their safety and hands them a copy of The Gift of Fear to read. This book is invaluable for professionals and the lay person who want to create or live in a safer environment.		The author does write with a bit of his ego coming through but he has the knowledge, experience and credentials to speak from strength. In essence, like a white tailed deer that raises that white flag like tail at any hint of danger, we all have an innate gift of fear but we allow social graces to override this all too often. This book will teach you to not live frightened, but to live aware and know that what your first instinct is, that is almost assuredly the right course of action to take to distance yourself from the danger."

The fact that it has lasted so long in print & stood the test of time is its best testimonial; I've not seen a negative review about it yet.		A couple of honest points first. There are too many references to other books & authors for my liking - a larger bibliography would have made reading easier. Also, there a many times De Becker mentions \"....& I'll covering such & such in more detail in chapter so & so). These niggles are minor compared to the nature of its important & potentially life saving content.		Something that would have made this interesting & fascinating book easier to refer back to would have been more sub-headings, highlighting & bullet points, perhaps even summary points at the end of each chapter.		This is a huge reference manual that ought to take a prominent place in any self-defence instructors book shelf.		They say - \"Prevention is better than Cure\" & so the main theme throughout is not finding yourself in a situation that could end up in some form of nasty conflict with an adversary that you would certainly not want to confront or fight. So instead of waiting for an attack to happen & then have to deal with the inevitable & nasty consequences of fighting, De Becker teaches us using many useful explanations about the use of intuition & how to recognise & nurture it. More importantly he tells us that we need to pay more attention to our intuition, gut feelings, hunches & suspicions. This he does very successfully by giving us the signals to look for in others, that we ought to be wary of & who may become dangerous; thus we avoid getting into difficulties.		The skills necessary to do this are done by repeating various easy techniques to good effect. I feel that we need this repetition to let these important life skills sink in well.		De Becker also teaches us that fear, when recognised & if reacted to in the correct manner, is a good & desirable thing. We need to learn to recognise those strange feelings, like butterflies inside of us, & put them into proper use.		Please don't be put off by the cover of the book that looks a little old fashioned or that it has been around since 1997. The title really does say it all & it includes all the skills & information you need within its 432 pages to help save our or our families lives.		Do check out De Beckers credentials from his website, he's easy to find on Google, should you feel the need to be convinced any further about his competency & experience to teach on the subject.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I'm fifteen years old. I'm probably one of the youngest readers of The Gift of Fear, but Gavin de Becker's words empowered me just as much as they did the next person. I loved the book. It made me realize that I have to stop ignoring my body, my intuition. If you haven't read this book, go out and get it! It will teach you so many things. This book should be required reading in high school, especially in girl's \"health\" classes. It is a practical, although at times scary, outline of the threats that can be around us. The layout is particularly good in that each chapter is a different specific threat.  DeBecker has set up the book as if it was a manual; he describes step by step how to keep you safe.  The way he organizes the information makes it much more understandable.  It's obvious he took his time getting all of his thoughts and beliefs down on paper.  As you red you sense a certain amount of fear in the way he writes, you can tell he is sincerely dedicated to warning and helping woman of the violence we have in our society today.  He's been through and witnessed violence (as he describes in his book) hearing what he thought and felt makes it easier to relate to your own life. Too bad we live in a world like this, but this book can give one an edge. The real life anecdotes blew me away. The account of the murdered woman who had reportedly suffered violence at the hands of the defendant for a long while. The calls to police, filing battery charges, lady killed by stabbing, defendant had a dream about killing her, his lawyers claiming it was drug dealers that committed murder. Sound familiar? DeBecker reveals that this true story happened six months before the famous \"white Bronco\" television event in a neighborhood thousands of miles from Brentwood. This book is too good NOT to read. Ever since a couple of years ago, I knew I wanted to help people. I'm the person my friends come to when they have a conflict, I like giving advice and solving people's dilemmas. There was one problem: I didn't heed my own advice. I didn't listen to myself many times because I could picture people saying, \"Oh, that's a silly suspicion.\" Fortunately, I have never been in a situation in which I deeply regret ignoring my intuition, but after reading The Gift of Fear I have learned how to listen to myself. I also baby-sit. The other day I was holding one of the children, and he pointed to one of his brother's friends and whispered to me, \"I'm scared of him.\" I thought for a moment and replied, \"Well, you know what? That's OK.\" I told him that if he's ever afraid, he should leave where that person is and go find Mommy, or me, or someone he knows and doesn't feel afraid. I was proud that he listened to his intuition, but I think I was more proud of my response. I was totally psyched that I had reinforced something he needs to survive. My point is that The Gift of Fear taught me how to use my gift of intuition and my gift of fear. Read the book because you will learn from it; you will use the tactics everyday. Gavin de Becker does an excellent job of sharing his experience in dealing with topics of understanding threats, predicting violence, workplace violence, stalking, domestic violence, and more. This book will shed new light in an area of our society where unwanted pursuits and violent behavior seem to be a part of our every day existence. Best of all, you will become more comfortable with every day life and you will use the wonderful treasures Mother Nature has given you because it was instilled in you by Gavin de Becker."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","First, this book should be read by everyone. While I agree with other reviewers that it contains a lot of common sense, a large number of people fail to use it when confronted with situations described in the book. If nothing else the book is a great reminder to use common sense. If everyone used common sense there would not be a need for a book like this. I know a number of people that have been involved in similar situations that were described in the book. Few chose the path of common sense. This always mystified me until I read the book. I can at least now understand why that happens. I would hope that if nothing else the book will re-awaken common sense in people when faced with a dangerous situation.		Second, the one reviewer that didn't read the book was most amusing. This is a good example where someone didn't use common sense. Without reading the book they have no crediblility. My common sense tells me that. I agree with the author's response to read the book and get the facts straight. It will definitely help them develop more common sense."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","It's tragic that Americans live with so much fear.  Some stimuli are straightforward: the road rager on our tail, a peeper at the window, or the group of young toughs on the corner eyeballing our approach.  However, many times we ignore or minimize fear when the cause isn't obvious.  For example, we feel anxiety towards the overly friendly stranger who offers to help with the groceries, or suspect that the withdrawn coworker who mutters threats at management may mean it.  Unfortunately, we tend to disregard our fears of such people until it's too late.  In \"The Gift of Fear,\" the author recommends that we recognize fear for what it is: an invaluable warning tool that can save us a lot of grief - if only we'd listen to it and react properly.		Gavin De Becker has a lot of experience with unstable and dangerous persons.  He grew up in a dysfunctional and violent home, and he credits that background with equipping him for his current profession, which is running a company that specializes in protecting \"the world's most famous and the world's most anonymous\" people.  He also designed a system called MOSAIC that screens threats to the U.S. Supreme Court.  \"The Gift of Fear\" illustrates various tactics used by predators to ensnare the unwary, such as Forced Teaming, Charm, and Persistence.  These tools are used to overcome our fear, which is based on an intuitive knowledge of what's in our best interests.  Therefore, we must recognize fear's legitimacy, even if we can't articulate the reasons behind it, and act decisively.  Mr. De Becker also provides insight into the psychological makeup of disgruntled employees, stalkers, and abusers.  Expecting them to react rationally to negotiation and restraining orders is an error of judgment (he labels judgment as \"the great enemy of perception, and thus accurate predictions\").  Alternatives such as a firm \"no means no\" stance and totally cutting off contact are explored in detail by the author.		This is a necessary book, and it has the added bonus of being an easy (if disconcerting) read.  However, I had an issue with Mr. De Becker's way of dealing with problem employees.  In the \"Occupational Hazards\" chapter, he states that companies have good results with counseling troubled employees, as long as management identifies them as a problem early on.  However, he skips that angle in favor of detailing the firing process.  I find that odd, since elsewhere he laments the lack of \"homicide prevention centers.\"  To his credit, Mr. De Becker places the burden on parents as the greatest determiners of a child's destiny (in the chapter \"Fear of Children\").  However, I would have liked him to spend more time on proactive restoration for adults.  I realize that employers aren't surrogate parents, but making a difficult employee someone else's problem is the easy way out.		The sad part of \"The Gift of Fear\" is it's negative indictment of men.  According to the author, men are statistically much more violent than women, and women pay the price for that tendency.  It's tragic that women have to automatically fear most men in order to protect themselves from a couple of predators.  That this book had to be written in the first place indicates that American society needs some deep healing.  Until that day comes, make sure that all female family members have a copy of \"The Gift of Fear.\"  As Oprah Winfrey said, \"Every woman in America should read this book.  It could save your life one day (pg. 363).\"		On a lighter note, I recommend reading \"The Gift of Fear\" in conjunction with \"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\" by Malcolm Gladwell.  Mr. Gladwell deals with intuition in other areas besides the criminal, and both books provide good insight into how our mind uses emotion to clue us in on what we already know."

Just don't let it make you paranoid.  After all the lists of what to look for in a dangerous man, the book should have had a list for what not to get too paranoid about.  I say that because at first glance, most of the lists could be applied to any man in a bar trying to get a females phone number.

Gavin De Becker advises another route: It's better to be rude than dead.<p>One of the main points he hammers home is how often women, afraid of being rude or hurting someone's feelings, allow themselves to get into dangerous situations. I can't count how many times I've done it: The guy at a party who says, &quot;Come over here -- there's a guy who says he knows you.&quot; The man who approaches you on the street and says, &quot;Hey, baby, you have a boyfriend?&quot;<p>De Becker also urges us to listen to our inner voice -- the one that says &quot;something here is wrong.&quot; Too often, we tell ourselves, &quot;I'm sure he's a perfectly nice man. There's nothing to worry about.&quot;<p>Also important is the chapter on how potential rapists/murders approach victims. The author explains how an attacker tries to get a victim to feel comfortable with him and thus make herself vulnerable.<p>Of course, there are also plenty of practical safety tips in here. (For example: Don't accept help from someone who approaches you. If you need it, ask for it: The chances of an attacker singling you out are far greater than vice versa.)"
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","In this book, Gavin de Becker discusses personal safety from several aspects. There is information for people who are being followed by a stalker, parents who are afraid of their children, women who want to end a relationship safely, bosses who want to fire employees, and so on. Some of the information and advise is very practical, and can be directly utilized to increase your safety. Some of the issues handled is more theoretical in nature, and serves more as an backround information. <p>The text is very interesting and easy to read, and not too scientific. Even with the more complicated subjects, the advise is very easy to understand, and it is illustrated with several stories from real life. There are some chapters that are not as useful (like the story on how de Becker's company found and helped police to apprehend a person who had killed several people and was stalking one of de Becker's clients), but still it is interesting to read about these thing as well. <p>I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but there was something missing to grant the missing fifth star. Although there are plenty of advise applicable to common situations, I believe that this book is more theoretical in nature than a real how-to book.

If you do become a victim, there are helpful directives on how to change your situation and release yourself from harmful relationships.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Read it and pay attention. Memorize the pins. Internalize the examples. Apply them to everything similar you encounter. They're *that* valuable.		DeBecker says there are always indicators when violence lies ahead. By \"violence,\" he sometimes means any harmful situation. One example he gives is a mother who felt uncomfortable when her child was going into surgery. Still, she told herself it would work out. And then her child died. Later, she went over the red flags that should have sent her looking for another doctor. So some examples are not about violence specifically, but are about events that are just as unfortunate and unsafe. Life is full of these situations, and there are clues at the ready if you pay attention to your instincts.		You'll get a feeling, a persistent thought, discomfort with someone or maybe a sense of uneasiness in an environment. Sometimes you'll just notice something when you ordinarily would not. There's a reason. As DeBecker says, \"violence is predictable.\" He tells us not to talk ourselves out of small clues, but to respect them for the teachers and lifesavers that they are. He also tells us to stop worrying about being \"polite.\" Discomfort about possibly offending anyone is a characteristic, or weakness, predators look for in victims.		Since first reading the book in 1997, I can think of specific instances when important clues presented themselves through an intuitive awareness. One of them was as simple as a mechanic misleading me so he could collect an easy fee. So the second most important lesson I have learned is to apply what the book teaches. If your instincts are signaling that something is just not right...stop...think...say no...complete a transaction after thinking for a few days. Whatever the situation, just don't ignore your instincts.		Everything DeBecker says is right on target and the truth of his advice will be even more apparent during the months after completing the book. As you become aware of situations where you did or should have stopped to think something through, many more will come up.		This is a book worth rereading every year and using as a reference whenever you're in a situation that tugs at the corners of your mind. Regular reminders and application of the material are important because while these situations do warn us, we still don't expect them and might be inclined to dismiss red flags."

Every other sentence out of her mouth was \"Gift of Fear this\" or \"Gift of Fear that,\" to the extent that we mocked her relentlessly about her joining the cult of the Gift of Fear.		But then I read it, and drank the Kool-Aid, too. De Becker's target demographic is women, but really, I think anyone could benefit from his advice, which can be summed up by saying follow your intuition. Maybe 420 pages is a lot to pages to say just that, but de Becker gives concrete examples of situations that can occur (or on the other hand, fizzle out before they even become a situation) by listening to yourself and how you feel about the people who come into your life.		Have you ever felt uncomfortable about someone or something, but reasoned that since you didn't have any good cause to be wary, you should just go ahead and be nice, or accommodating, or whatever else we're taught to be? According to de Becker, you should go ahead and distance yourself from this person - your discomfort is reason enough.		Especially interesting to me was how predictive de Becker is of the media's portrayal of events and the people who commit them. The Gift of Fear was written the year before the Columbine massacre, but his profiling of the killers of that and other attacks seems spot on. With the Colorado theater shooting and Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin still fresh in our minds, this is a worthwhile book for all to read. Although those events may have not been preventable on the days of the attacks, there were probably signs in advance that those around the killers should have seen."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This is a gripping book that won't let you out of its grasp until you get to the end. But it's not a thriller. Instead, its a primer on how to deal with violence that can intrude into our lives at any time.		Gavin de Becker is well-versed in the cost of violence to society. He came from a family in which violence was a part of daily life, and he heads a company dedicated to protecting people from it.		But this book is not a cliched recital of facts. Nor does it encourage you to go around fearful and clutching at your keys. What I thought was most valuable about this book was de Becker's insistence that we learn to distinguish from ordinary worry, which decreases our ability to be fully present, and fear, which can save our lives. For example, the book opens with a gripping story in which a victim saved her own life by getting up and following her attacker out of her apartment. Later, she said she felt possessed as she traveled down that corridor silently behind him, and exited to safety while he went into her kitchen to look for a knife. She explained that her inner voice had told her to do this, promising her it would get her out of this horrible situation alive.		This is what de Becker means when he talks about the gift of fear. It is that inner voice which can read situations very fast, so fast that there is literally no time to think about it. In our secular rationalistic society, people often feel embarrassed that they take a dislike to someone on sight, that they feel uncomfortable getting into an elevator with that person, that something just didn't feel right. But how silly to pay attention to such vague feelings. Because intuition can be so unreliable. Right?		Wrong! says de Becker. While it might be true that intuition can be unreliable, it is still valuable to listen carefully to these warnings. We have all had these experiences. I remember one sunny day walking out by myself along a path frequented by joggers and cyclists. On this particular occasion there was no-one in sight, either to the front or back of me. And yet I did not feel like continuing upon that path. So I turned around and walked back. Nothing happened. Was I right, or wrong? I don't know. But at least I didn't suffer through a horrible experience.		For anyone who worries about personal safety, buy this book and read it frequently. It achieves the right balance between being prudent and realistic, and making your life a misery with too much worry. Five stars."

If I'd had Mr. De Beckers book back then, there is every probability that I never would have given either of those men the chance to get near me.	  In this day, I have two knock-out neices, ages 15 & 17. I've done my best to teach them that they are like the lions on the veldt. The mama lion one day takes her babies out hunting, then she disappears and the baby will either suvive or ir won't, so I must give them all the tools they need to flourish in a world I can't possibly imagine that they'll be living in.	  The Gift of Fear was my gift to them; just one more weapon in their arsenal of survival skills, and hopefully, they avoid some of the mistakes I made in my life. I now understand that my seeming cold and stand-offish (which I am neither), is the best way to appear in the beginning. I make sure to make people show me their worth before I allow them to become closer in my life, where they are allowed to see the warmth, and willingness to help with whatever issue they may be going through.

If we feel we don't have any instinct about these things, deBecker gives us an objective check list of Pre-Incident Indicators that we can use to clue us in to danger. I can't speak highly enough about the value of this information. It's an easy, entertaining read. It is a book that should be read, shared, and reread periodically to keep the information fresh."

Some of the authors had been stalked and one recommended this book. I sampled it on my Kindle  and then bought it. I enjoyed the whole lesson. Gavin de Becker was born into a dangerous home. He grew up witnessing horrible crimes. To protect himself and his little sister, Gavin learned to differentiate between fear and intuition. He learned not to live afraid, but instead to let his intuition guide him when he needed to act. He grew up to become an expert in threat assessment and his firm consults with everyone from the Secret Service to celebrities to average citizens all over the world. This was a real page turner, in simple to understand terms. Some of his case studies were so engrossing I had to stop and remind myself I was reading nonfiction, not a fictional thriller. I loved the book and hope that I come away with my intuition fine tuned and my nonproductive worry and fear cast aside. I recommend this book to everyone."

While there is some valid information in \"The Gift of Fear\", any useful material is lost in a muddle of anecdotes and misinformation.  Mr DeBecker portrays all women as helpless victims incapable of proactive thought, and demeans them by repetitively suggesting that any danger they encounter is a result of their own ignorance or poor planning.  Constant references to celebrities who he refuses to name make this book into a petulant exercise in name-dropping, and his liberal bias, particularly a voraciously anti-gunowner slant, permeates nearly every page.  Furthermore, despite authoritative overtones that imply serious research, the author offers almost no scientific backing to his claims, leaving his conclusions hollow, empty, and subjective.		I wish I could be more positive about this book, particularly after seeing some of the other reviews, but any attempt on Mr DeBecker's part to make this a scholarly endeavor has been destroyed by his own bloviation."

I suppose the book should have been written in such a way so that one could not guess political bias.  This is not a book about politics.<p>If one can sift through this, one can gather good information.  Much of the information seems to be padding.  There are long passages in which practical information is missing.  This is esp. true in the first third of the book.

Let me give you an example... that example reminds me of another example of why this book is good for you....&quot;  <p>When practical information is given, it is very good, yet seems brief.  The useful infomation is short (such as one page in a chapter).  What makes up much of the book is theory and the author's personal cases.  <p>What is lacking are illustrations of the practical information.  Such would be very helpful, but such illustrations are few, replaced with examples to illustrate theory.  These theories lend themselves to interjections of liberal points of view.<p>Here is an example.  &quot;I think we should talk about what to do if you are faced with a man pointing a gun at you.  What should you do?  Well, let me tell you the story of a case I was on involving a class that contained a student with a gun....  The point of this example was to show that these people did not have the tools to handle the situation.  Now, if they had read this book they would have been prepared.  You are reading this book and so you are prepared.  This proves that we need gun control laws.  Back to our situation.  What should you do if you are faced with a man pointing a gun at you?  We will deal with that in a later chapter.  Until that time, let me give you another example of a case I worked on.&quot;<p>You get the point.

Positives:		* Interesting stories throughout	* Chapter 4 very helpful for identifying true \"stranger danger\"	* Chapter 15 is a great summary of the book and explains clearly what to be fearful of and what to let go.

I'm probably one of the youngest readers of The Gift of Fear, but Gavin de Becker's words empowered me just as much as they did the next person.  I loved the book.  It made me realize that I have to stop ignoring my body, my intuition.  If you haven't read this book, go out and get it!  It will teach you so many things.  Ever since a couple of years ago, I knew I wanted to help people.  I'm the person my friends come to when they have a conflict, I like giving advice and solving people's dilemmas.  There was one problem: I didn't heed my own advice.  I didn't listen to myself many times because I could picture people saying, &quot;Oh, that's a silly suspicion.&quot;  Fortunately, I have never been in a situation in which I deeply regret ignoring my intuition, but after reading The Gift of Fear I have learned how to listen to myself.  I also babysit.  The other day I was holding one of the children, and he pointed to one of my brother's friends and whispered to me, &quot;I'm scared of him.&quot;  I thought for a moment and replied, &quot;Well, you know what?  That's OK.&quot;  I told him that if he's ever afraid, he should leave where that person is and go find Mommy, or me, or someone he knows and doesn't feel afraid.  I was proud that he listened to his intuition, but I think I was more proud of my response.  I was totally psyched that I had reinforced something he needs to survive.  My point is that The Gift of Fear taught me how to use my gift of intuition and my gift of fear.  Read the book because you will learn from it; you will use the tactics everyday.  Best of all, you will become more comfortable with every day life and you will use the wonderful treasures mother nature has given you because it was instilled in you by Gavin de Becker.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This book starts out with a really interesting example of a woman who is accosted by a \"kindly\" stranger in her apartment complex, who talks his way into her apartment and then rapes her. After he's done raping her, he leaves her in the bedroom and tells her to stay put, that he won't hurt her. She realizes that he's going to kill her (he closes the window and assures her he's going to get a drink - but why would he close the window if he doesn't intend to kill her? he has a gun, but he probably doesn't want to make noise, so he's going to the kitchen to get a knife). She sneaks out behind him instead of staying put, so even though she's been raped, she doesn't get killed. It turns out that they catch the guy and find out that he has raped and killed other women.		The \"Gift of Fear\" in the title refers to the intuitive ability of human beings that allows them to detect danger quickly, without conscious, logical thought. There's some good stuff in the book about how to recognize intuition, and also (in the very last chapter) how to distinguish real fear of real dangers from worry about hypothetical dangers.		The rest of the book, the swollen middle, would probably be useful if you are a wealthy, famous person or a large corporation that is in a position to enlist Mr. de Becker's security firm's services. There's a lot of stuff about how a business can detect problem employees, and some other stuff about how movie stars can recognize dangerous fans.		There are a few good tips on how to get a stalker to leave you alone, and how restraining orders might cause more trouble than they solve. But there's precious little else in the realm of practical measures. In other words, let's say my intuitive Gift of Fear has told me that the guy following me on the trail I'm hiking is bad news. Now what? What do I do next? This book doesn't answer that.		I'd recommend reading the first and last chapters of The Gift of Fear, and skipping the rest.

There are definite signs of what we should fear and what is not necessary to fear.  There are also positive steps that can be taken to avoid putting ourselves into a potentially dangerous situation. He teaches what an individual can do to, not only become aware of potential danger, but often to avoid it.  He then follows up with specific information pertinent to workplace violence, domestic violence, date stalking, violent children, and attacks against public figures.

(I was 12 and 13 yrs old)	-I've had countless men demand that I get into their car, I've been followed in stores and down the street by strangers.	-I've been grabbed and manhandled in crowded clubs or at concerts and couldn't identify who had done it because my immediate area was so crowded.	 The terrifying thing about these situations I've just illustrated is that I could walk up to any woman on the street and she could tell me similar stories.  One of the most important things I learned from this book were the specific methods used by attackers to convince a woman to let them into their house, give them a ride, etc.  Now that I know the methods, I recall that many of them have been used on me. This is frightening because I know there are girls and women out there who find it difficult to say no to a man, are too trusting, easily charmed, or quick to rationalize their intuition. I say EVERY woman should read this book! I particularly believe that teenage girls should not only read it, but commit it to memory. It really could save your life, and offers insight into HOW these predators lure and persuade their marks. Once you know the methodology of these creeps, you can spot them blindfolded.	  Also equally as important were the other topics covered, such as how to deal with a stalker (also extremely important information for all women-we've all dealt with exes who wouldn't let go, or persistent suitors who won't take no for an answer)	  It is unfortunate that women are treated as prey but it is a hard reality. All women should be equipped to deal with potentially violent or threatening circumstances. We are victims only if we fail to educate ourselves. Read this book to garner that education!

The books are exciting and a person who ever reads books should be able to get through these and enjoy them.		2. Good citizenship. Governments have recognized the expertise of this man, and he has helped devise computer programs and so on to help with such things as police work. The American government, in particular, has posted signs with slogans such as \"If you see something, say something,\" and other concepts derived essentially from these books or works like them. Taken out of context, such slogans could be used to deny rights and freedoms to perfectly honorable people who are a little different in some way. That would be a horrific outcome.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Last weekend I stopped to help two stranded motorists and ended up inadvertently driving a prostitute all over town and helping one of the passengers obtain some drugs. I sheepishly told the story to a colleague, who said I have GOT to read \"The Gift of Fear\"<p>I finished it in two days. It is engaging and interesting: lots of sex and violence. The main thesis of the book is that violent acts do not occur without warning, and trusting and sharpening one's intuition (gut feeling) may save your life. The author recounts how he grew up in a violent home and founded on of the largest risk assessment agencies in the world; one that advices police, movie stars, the FBI, the CIA, and anyone else worried about a possible assailant. After recounting dozens of murders and rapes, he ends his book by warning about watching too much violence in television and becoming overly worried. In his afterward, he recounts tales of several people who have been helped by his book.<p>Now let me add a little of my own pop psychology: when one is in a conversation with another person, there are two useful things to ask yourself (other than the obvious question of veracity): why is the person telling me what they are and what are they not telling me that normally would be included.<p>So I'm going to pretend, that the book is the author's conversation. First the why. The author wants to warn us to protect us. But also he includes dozens of examples about how astute he and his agency are. He engages us by telling us that he too has been a victim. He tells us that one can always protect oneself if we use the teachings found in the book, and that in the future it is likely that genetic testing or chemical testing of another individual will do away with his computer test assessments. There is a bit of blaming the victim: they somehow put up blinders to the signals they were getting and they should have known. I've heard the same thing about holocaust victims, and it disturbs me.<p>Second: what is not told. All murders drank milk at one time in their lives, so milk drinking predicts violence. What is the chance of these same signals occuring in non violent situations? Which are really predictive in differentiating safe from unsafe situations? All people who shoot others have bought, borrowed, or stolen guns, so the absence of these totally predicts safety from being shot, but what is the actual risk from all persons that have a gun. How often to men stop to help a woman that is lifting a heavy suitcase and say \"Let me help you with that\" (when undoubtedly they should ask rather than say \"May I help you\") If one wants to talk to someone else, might one use the term \"we\" rather than \"you\" and \"I\" just out of the desire for conversation? These are grey areas.<p>But  most importantly, what is left out is why we discount our intuitions and how we can recognise and correct this. The answer can be found in most con games: we discount our instincts out of pride, greed, habituation, ethical bent, etc. That really should have been directly discussed rather than briefly touched on in a disconnected way.<p>So if the conclusion is to be more attentive to our \"gut feelings\", the conclusion is the same as a hundred other self help books and somewhat banal. I would give this a 3/5 stars for engaging writing and some good insights into human nature and descriptions of details often left out of news reports. I wish he diminished his self promotion and scare tactics and had commented on frequency of PIM's in non dangerous situations."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","The Gift of Fear does take an in-depth look at the pitfalls of celebrity life as well as addressing the dangers of American society.  DeBecker paints a grim picture of violence in America, but also states that the media is largely responsible for our anxieties and fears.  We hear and see so much violence on television that we are almost desensitized.  Our basic instinct is eroding to the point where we can no longer distinguish the difference between real fear and worry.  He offers scenarious which illustrate the differences between these two emotions.<p>He also states that we have a better chance of hurting ourselves than someone else doing it for us.  How?  We ignore our basic instincts when someone approaches, whose behavior is questionable.  The Gift of Fear not only addresses the signals these people throw at us, but tells us how we should handle that person.<p>In his book, he fictionizes his cases to illustrate how women put themselves in a situation where they beaten, raped, stalked, and murdered.  At the end, he summarizes how they could have avoided their snag.  He points out that the police and judicial system offer little to help these women once they are in this situation.  I, myself, have heard about this scenario many times.<p>What got to me was a thirteen year-old boy, named Eric.  He and his mother had their luggage stolen while on vacation.  The hotel manager was very helpful and 'nice'.  He was so nice that he made a special trip across the country to see this boy.  In short, he was a sexual predator.  Fortunately for Eric, his mother was put off by this man.  Out of all the stories recounted in this book, this one gave me chills.  <p>Again, DeBecker lists the danger signs that we should watch out for and the common sense tactics of avoiding these criminals.  At the back of the book, is a list of agencies who help battered women and children cope and survive.  I would recommend this book for everyone."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I recently re-read \"The Gift Of Fear\" by Gavin de Becker as I planned to give two copies away during a presentation I made on safety to a large group of women.  The conference was last week, and I indeed gave two copies away.  One went to a volunteer during the program, and the other was given through a drawing near the end of my session.  Why did I give this book away?  The same reason I've given many other copies away during self-defense and safety programs, and for the same reason I read it again.  It is a very good book!  In fact, if you trust Oprah Winfrey's opinion, she once said, \"every woman in America should read this book.\"  I'd like to add that it is also a good book for men to read, and if you teach self-defense and safety, it is a must read.  De Becker's research and the information he provides is extremely valuable to all of us helping others remain safe.		The subtitle of the book is \"and other survival signals that protect us from violence.\"  These signals are so important.  While the entire book is full of useful information and suggestions, as well as stories that just might shock you when realizing just what some people do to others, I think the most important lesson from the book, which is illustrated well through examples, is to pay attention to your intuition.  And if you are a man, and not into your intuition, then listen to your \"gut feelings,\" they are the same thing.		The book contains many stories of real cases, and there is a lot to be learned from these.  Criminals repeat patters, and by studying what others have done, it becomes easier to predict what others will do.  Many acts of violence are predictable and preventable if you pay attention to the signals.  This book helps point out those signals so you'll be better prepared to recognize them.		The book covers intuition and predicting, as well as workplace violence, domestic violence, stalkers, attacks against public figures, violent children, and much more.  I really can't say this enough, if you are concerned with your own safety, and you should be, read this book and pay attention to the lessons it contains.		I don't agree with de Becker on everything, especially his stance on firearms.  But that is okay, I still believe him to be one of the country's leading experts on violent behavior, and I'm grateful for what I've learned from him that assists me with teaching people to be safe.  I highly recommend this book, because as the cover says, \"this book can save your life.\"		Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the DVD Streetfighting Essentials."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This book is very insightful into how intuition works, and encourages the reader to listen to her or his intuition, with which I totally agree.  The book was very informative in that respect, and for the most part, an entertaining read.  However, after most of the case histories, I couldn't help but think, \"...but then what do you do?\"  Although the author espouses an anti-gun viewpoint, the many examples of intuition working to warn of true danger actually prompted me to think that having a weapon might be a very good thing in those instances.  Yes, recognizing intuitively that you are in mortal danger is helpful, but it doesn't eliminate the danger itself.  You are still left to deal with the danger if you are already in a situation in which it can't be avoided.  He did offer some advice, such as it's better to approach someone for help rather than wait for someone to offer it, but there weren't as many suggestions as in some other books.  He recommends a certain self-defense course, but honestly, most women are simply no match for a man who has no inhibitions about harming another person.  Granted, on some occasions intuition can help avoid getting into a dangerous situation in the first place.  That we tend to try to explain away our intuition with so-called logic is also a valid and valuable point, and one of the highlights of the book.  To penalize the author for lack of a magic defense would be unfair, so I'm rating the book at 4 stars, although the message that intuitively recognizing danger somehow almost solves the problem was a little frustrating after awhile.		The self-promotion mentioned in several other reviews really didn't bother me; his security business experience is one of the reasons he is considered an expert in the field.  However, his anti-gun pitch at the end seemed contradictory after so many tales of extreme danger.  Gun ownership carries many responsibilities and should not be taken lightly, or by some at all, but to recommend that citizens get rid of their guns just didn't click after reading the rest of the book.  The harrowing tales made me want to go buy one and learn how to use it.		I also had mixed feelings about the advice to turn off the news and basically stop worrying about danger because your intuition will be all the warning you'll need.  Sounded a little like pie in the sky.  Not that constant worrying is a good thing, but as in one case mentioned, if I had to go to my car alone every night in a large deserted parking lot, I would find it hard to put the possibliity of danger out of my conscious mind, too, even if I had a basic problem with living in LA.  Perhaps a fine line separates wariness and worrying.		The book is still definitely worth reading and has good chapters on subjects such as stalking."

Advocates cutting off communication completely with people who will not leave you alone.		The bad points:		1. Promotes the idea that avoiding crime is solely a matter of using intuition and psychology to predict criminal behavioral.	2. Tends to make it sound as if the police and courts are unable to handle criminals without the help of the author's security firm.	3. You will likely find yourself wishing that you could afford to hire his security firm to help you figure out all of the difficult people that you encounter.	4. Offers little real self defense strategy beyond early recognition of criminals and avoidance.	5.

Having lived through and learned from a number of traumatic experiences, I have learned to trust the kind of electrical buzz that surges through me at times.  It is fear, yes.  I can listen to it or I can use my intellect to discount it.  A lot of the times when I discounted it, I got into trouble.  What I am sensing is that something is not quite right or that the setup, the circumstances, are putting me into a position that I have to trust the individual more than I would like.  I think that this is a nice person. I think that my electrical surge feeling is just unfortunate garbage from my past.  Every time I discount it, I get into trouble and I loose something.  The Gift of Fear is correct.  Trust your intuitions. People who have been hurt in the past have a better set of intuitions.  People who have not been hurt feel silly to trust the intuition.  Intuition and common sense are God given.  Say thank you and use these gifts.  In a sense I like this book but on the other hand I feel it is creating fear.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This book does a very good job of helping people recognize behaviors and actions that may lead to trouble.  Unfortunately, this book has some flaws and certainly could have been better.		Mr. De Becker is clearly an expert at teaching about manipulation, grooming, and other patterns of behavior that often precede violence.  He does a great service in explaining techniques used by antisocials and ways to counteract them by following our instincts.		On the down side, the book contains a lot of anti-gun propaganda.  The author tends to make unsubstantiated claims about how having a gun makes one less safe.  He uses a couple of examples while ignoring the hundreds of cases annually where individuals with weapons have saved their own lives or those of others.		Additionally, he tends to do a lot of self promotion for his company and name dropping of the ultra leftist elites of Hollywood.  Although it may impress some readers that he has connections with Rosie O'Donnell and Barbara Streisand, it certainly does nothing to enhance his credibility.  On the contrary, it makes him appear to be a liberal with an agenda.  In this case, that is making people less self reliant for their own protection while promoting his company.  That is unfortunate as it takes away from the rest of the book that is so good.		In spite of the propaganda and self promotion, I would encourage people to read this book.  It has a lot of good to go along with the bad parts.  It might just help save the life of someone who is involved with an abusive partner or dealing with a stalker."

Gavin de Becker has provided us with an awareness of the necessity to re-awaken the \"gift\".  This book should be THE \"gift\" of choice to all those we love and seek to protect.  I should know because it happened to me.  I did not know why I was afraid of a man who was coming up my walk and whom I could see through a window that ran alongside my front door.  He was \"ordinary\" looking but I asked the friend, with whom I was having a telephone conversation at the time, to stay on the line while I went to the door.  I was tense and apprehensive.  The man was asking for directions and I answered through the closed door.  Something in his manner and words was amiss.  He became very insistent that I open the door but I would not give in. Finally he went away, visibly angry with me, and tried the same tactic at the home of a neighbour around the bend.  She had a chain installed on her door and when she refused to open the door to him, he drew a knife and tried to break the chain.  My neighbour managed to slam the door shut and called the police.  I repeat, he look ordinary, was casually and appropriately dressed, was slight of stature, but sent out a message that my inner voice picked up and transmitted to me as saying, \"something is not right about that guy\". This did not happen in the inner city; it was in a quiet suburban neighbourhood, in broad daylight, and took place some years ago when this sort of incident was relatively rare.  I listened; I was unharmed; and I'm here to tell you how important that awareness was and is.

Still, De Becker is terribly knowledgable on how a desperate human mind works (for both attacker and attacked) and does a good job of relating it to the reader using stories, examples, and plain speech. The occassional tangent (on local news, for example) is forgivable, because of the importance of his message.

I had to sneak out of my own house, bought the book, and stayed up all night reading it because I needed a plan.  The stalking even caused me to move out of my own house, and at one point, I nearly got my stalker killed in traffic while I was trying to get away from him.  The advice Mr. de Becker gives <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440508835\">The Gift of Fear and Other Survival Signals that Protect Us From Violence</a>is right on the money.

She could not stop talking about it.  This book empowers you. It teaches you to trust your instincts by showing the difference between instinct and anxiety. Don't be turned off by the title, although it sounds a little ominous, once you read the book it will make perfect sense."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I have completed the book The Gift of Fear. It is a worthwhile investment of my time and money. Working in Homeland Security and leading a security team at my church, will both be benefitted by the concepts set forth in this book. I think it should be read, and taught, to all young people, both male and female, starting at about 11 or 12 years of age. It would be good to learn from it at any age. The reason I used \"just not all the answers\" in the preview, is that it offers great advice on trusting intuition, recognizing fear for what it is, that being something that has not occured yet, and may or may not occur, and recognizing warning signs of violence. It does not however, offer any substantive advice or counsel on what to do if you do everything right, and still encounter violence. There is nothing that will preclude all violence as long as we live on this earth, so knowing how to recognize violence and avoid it are great to a point. There will however always be acts of violence, and you will still be just as raped, assaulted and murdered, whether being aware or unaware of what precludes and perpetuates violence. The author appears to be staunchly anti-gun, and ridicules legitimate, responsible and Second Amendment confirmed rights of gun ownership. I suspect the authors team would be likely armed in anticipation of a confrontation with one of their clients stalkers. They would be foolish if they were not. You can take many measures to avoid and even mitigate violence, you cannot however, take steps that will lead to total avoidance. In those cases only violence of greater force, more accuracy, and greater speed will overcome this violence. The book is a good read, and you will learn at lot from it as I did, just don't expect it to be your total savior if violence should come your way."

It is not a positive uplifting book, as some of the examples are very dark, but I do believe it can save a person's life.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Nearly ten years after its publication, The Gift of Fear rightly has a slate of Amazon reviews probably longer than the book. Valid criticism is available in every \"star\" category. Sometimes, however, a book transcends even its gripping thesis; The Gift of Fear does this.		It does so by a subtle repetition of the incontrovertible fact: Evil exists. De Becker's easy-to-read style drives home this reality. Even if--as the book's nastiest reviews point out--at points its message seems self-interested (\"the reader needs professional guidance in order to protect herself; hire us\"), so what? Do artisans or experts in other fields, who write How To books, never lead readers to infer sometimes professional help is mandatory? Psychologists do it all the time!		What I particularly admired about The Gift of Fear isn't its \"You might have acted differently if you had been armed with what I'll tell you\" stuff. It was De Becker's unflinching belief in Evil and Evil's many guises. That he ignores what one negative reviewer mincingly points out: pride often leads to victimization, is not the book's issue.		Of course pride leads to victimization. Innocence leads to victimization. Hindsight--a fool's or an innocent's--is always 20/20. Should De Becker not have written this unapologetic analysis of the wicked mind because potential victims might be stupid, lazy, or even wicked themselves?		The book's final message is like Cat Steven's song: \"Baby, Baby, It's a Wild World.\" Will crime victims yet to be victimized prevent crimes from happening to them if they read it? Maybe not. Crimes of the magnitude De Becker details aren't committed by idiots. But if The Gift of Fear keeps one single woman from opening the door to a handsome \"repairman\"; if it makes one father suspicious of a son's overly polite and talkative best friend; if it gives one co-ed an intuition that leaving a party with a \"personality guy\" might not be a good idea, then it will be more than worth reading. It will have saved a life."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","For the most part agree with the perspective of Gavin De Becker, it is true that fear can be a gift and keep us out of harm's way. It is important though, to realize that sometimes our fears can go too far and become paranoia. Yes, we should embrace our fears and realize that fear is nature's way of keeping us on the right path and out of dangerous situations. I enjoyed Gavin's works. As a person who has suffered PTSD, I would only caution some to realize that sometimes fear can go too far and is not always healthy. Good book!

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","That's the central message of the book, and one that may save your life if you listen to it.		Through this book, de Becker has convinced me that most violence can be predicted. He goes through a great many common situations in which violence happens in the U.S., from encounters with strangers, workplace violence to domestic violence and date stalking. In each situation, he describes the indicators of likely violence. Some of these indicators are so often overlooked and rationalized away by the people involved. My favorite one is called: \"Refusal to take no for an answer.\" It can be as trivial as the new date persisting in offering you a drink. Although trivial, such incidents are very telling about his tendency toward violence.		De Becker also discusses a characteristic in many people that blunts out their intuition to actual dangers: unwarranted anxiety. Due to media and social conditioning and other influences, those people feel fear or anxiety in situations that do not pose actual dangers. Such unwarranted anxiety makes them confused and oblivious to the real signals from their intuition. De Becker offers ways for people to overcome that curse and live a life relatively free from fear and anxiety.		In short, I would highly recommend this book. It is one of the few books should be read by everyone (both men and women)."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","A gift..  De Becker repeatedly offers us acceptance of our humanness. Our fear is a gift. Our instincts are trustworthy. We know far more than we think we know... we sense things with our intuition. Here we are encouraged to trust ourselves. Society has taught us to po-po our senses or to downright distrust them. However, they feed us knowledge beyond that which our sight alone can offer.  De Becker knows his topic from the inside out, having been raised in violence. But rather than following his family's example, he has chosen the \"high road\" of learning and educating others. The outside of the book does not sound his trumpet but this guy is internationally known. I found his method of communicating to be personal and encouraging, his handling of the topic to be helpful and wise. Having faced much violence in my own childhood, this work helped me to feel better equipped for life: knowing that my fear is a gift and understanding how to use this gift to keep me safe. And I would even say that I am a more confident person for having read this work. Thank you, de Becker."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","Several years ago my friend Carol tried to break up with her boyfriend Steve (not his real name). He threatened to kill her and tried a couple of times. The TRO was ineffective. After the first couple of weeks the cops were not much help either. I remember trying to fall asleep on her couch with a shotgun wondering why she hadn't seen this train wreck coming a whole lot sooner. Long story short, he's in jail; she's fine. She did not go on another date for more than two years afterward, however, until I bought her this book. It is illuminating and empowering. The best, most holistic treatise on the subject I've ever read.		Seems like every time there is a tragedy in the news where someone goes on a rampage, some reporter interviews the shocked neighbors who thought the guy or gal was perfectly normal until one day they snapped. Gavin DeBecker puts this nonsense to rest. There is always an indication ahead of time if you are trained to see it. This book is a step-by-step guide on how to identify these cues and avoid danger.		The same thing works on a national scale. When the President or Homeland Security asks us to be vigilant, what the heck does that mean? DeBecker sums it up quite well, \"Before the courageous FBI raid, before the arrest, long before the news conference, there is a regular American citizen who sees something that seems suspicious, listens to intuition, and has the character to risk being wrong or seeming foolish when making the call to authorities.\"		This is an outstanding book.

Unlike many other &quot;self-help psychology&quot; books out there, &quot;The Gift of Fear&quot; doesn't pull any punches in talking about how violence is all around us. But it also teaches us how to protect ourselves from it, and gives very interesting insights into the minds of people that have minds similar to those who would harm us.

Towards the end of the book he describes an incident where a burglar surprises a father who is sleeping. The burglar has the father's gun in his hand and ends up holding the father and his daughters for about an hour.  GdeB goes on to describe how the burglar ends up leaving the CD player he was going to steal, but took the gun with him. He also says the burglar did the father and his family a favor by taking the gun from them and getting it out of  the house.		Throughout the book this theme rears its ugly head from time to time.  I would have enjoyed the book much better if GdeB had kept his anti gun rhetoric out of it.  There was nothing constructive added to the book by his rhetoric and he ignores the fact that privately owned firearms are used thousands of times a year to protect the owners and others from violence.

I immediately bought eight copies to give to friends and family!		Written in a captivating style, Gavin de Becker gives provides practical information through anecdotes, which makes the information easier to recall once the book has been laid aside.		Women tend to get into dangerous situations when they don't listen to the tiny internal voice which warns them of danger, or because they don't want to appear \"rude\".  For example, when waiting alone for an elevator, what happens when the elevator door opens and there's only one person in the elevator -- a man whose appearance raises the hair on the back of the neck?  Fearful of appearing \"rude\", many women will squelch the internal voice that says to wait for the next elevator, and they'll get into that soundproof metal box with the very person their body has warned them about.  Even if the person turns out to be harmless, the woman spends the entire elevator ride queasy at the thought of what might happen during those shared few minutes.		Gavin de Becker examines the question of \"WHY do we do what we do?\" and \"WHY do OTHERS do what THEY do?\"  An overly solicitious stranger who refuses to take \"NO\" for an answer, is not being as helpful as they portend to be.  In that example, de Becker emphasizes that \"No\" is a complet sentence.  No need to elaborate or explain.  \"No\" means \"NO\".		What if the person isn't a stranger?  The same advice applies.  De Becker says that if a jumbo jet filled with passengers crashed into a mountainside, killing all aboard, and that happened month in and month out, it still wouldn't equal the number of women killed each year by husbands and boyfriends.		This book should be required reading for every female over the age of 15, and the chapter dealing with workplace violence should be required reading for everyone who works outside the home, whether or not they manage other people.		THE GIFT OF FEAR by Gavin de Becker is an excellent book.  I'm just sorry that it took me ten years to start reading it.		<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440508835\">The Gift of Fear and Other Survival Signals that Protect Us From Violence</a>"

Gavin presents very easy concepts in this book that can enable any of us to be mindful of danger even if we aren't educated in such things.  By \"listening to yourself\" you are just as educated if not more so than the professionals who use their education in predicting violence, not their own intuition.		Plenty of real-life experiences are shared with the reader as Gavin delves into the minds of violent, angry, and distraught.  Minds that are not far from any of our own because, we are all human.  This may rattle some by linking the minds of criminals with our own, but it is just the kind of rattle we need to know that we already instinctly know and can address potentially violent or dangerous behavior before it it too late.		Along with these experiences, Gavin has even more credibilty than your average intuition expert because he practices what he preaches.  Gavin owns, manages, and contracts his own private security firm and Threat Assessment Management to clients who can afford such services.  Another book that Gavin has co-authored, \"Just 2 Seconds\", goes into more detail about preventing attacks and his company.  It is an asset to those security and protection professionals in that line of work and a tremendous resource for the general pubilc to see the effort and passion that Gavin has for his area of expertise.		Gavin has produced two insightful reads given to and for the benefit of all who wish to answer the \"why\" and \"how\" of intuition, self-development, and personal safety/security.  Both titles have been informative and a great reference for this reader.  I recommend and guarantee \"The Gift of Fear\" and any of Gavin's other novels will do a great service for all those who pick it up."

However, if you've actually been a victim of violence, and you're not entirely steady on your feet hearing such discussions carried out matter of fact-ly, then this book may trigger you to feel unwell - all without the benefit of conveyance of HOW to stay safe from such violence.		Case in point - the audio version (same as the print version I am told) opens with the detailed description of the way a stalking and rape played out. It was told in a cold, clinical manner and felt painful to hear. However, I told myself, \"it's okay to listen - afterwards he'll describe how to counter each of the mistakes the victim made in this crime.\" The problem was, the author DID NOT describe point by point how to avoid this situation. Essentially, it all came down to the victim not following her intuition. Intuition -  that's a vague tip. I'd rather he explained to me point by point as the story went along, \"here is where she should have done THIS to save herself ...\"  It was simply unpleasant listening especially without a strong point for learning. These sorts of depressing, and sometimes gory, details can be found readily on the evening news. What I wanted from this book was training in avoiding such dangers.		Further along in the book, the author explained how we share many similarities with these criminals. That's interesting, I admit. I can see some of the point. We are all human. However, I couldn't help getting the feeling that maybe after all the author's own personal experiences of violence, and working with the criminally insane at points in his career, that maybe he was looking a little too deeply into the mind of the criminal and possibly getting a skewed view of these supposed similarities we share.		Further in the book, the author discussed the real life serial killer who was the inspiration for the Silence of the Lambs book and film. Then he began to detail exactly what this serial killer was \"taking\" from his victims. That tripped too big of a trigger for me. While it is necessary to be aware of general violence in order to stay safe from violence, that doesn't mean we need to know every last detail of the actions of these perpetrators. Way too much information.		In the end, there was a lot of dissection of crimes and criminals - but just a scant sprinkling of how to avoid becoming a victim by using our own intuition. I agree, we do need to hone our skills of observation - and I agree with the author that intuition is an extension of our observations - however, he needed to elaborate on just HOW to act on that intuition. In the opening story of the woman who was stalked and raped - when she was approached by the rapist who was offering to carry her grocery bags, what should her response have been? How exactly do you tell them not to help you - how do you not trigger their violent behavior, and possibly trigger an even larger crime from happening?  THESE things would have been a major help. It is a pity the author didn't offer this sort of help."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","The Gift of Fear is a overall good book that opens your eyes to things that you may not have noticed before, and teaches you to pay more attention to your innate survival signals.  It also does a good job of stressing overall awareness of your surroundings.  Having said that, I think there were a few instances where he inappropiately places intuition over logic.  For example, I cannot remember what page it was, but he stated that a woman had a violent boyfriend who threatened to kill her, beat her, etc., and then goes on to say that the woman's intuition should have told her something was wrong.  If someone threatens such things, it's not intuition to think something is wrong, it is perfectly reasonable.  That, and it seemed he tried to inject too many anti-gun arguments, when the book was about how to deal with violent people, not how they acquirerd the means to be violent.  Still, it's a good book, but I think I would have given it three and a half stars if I could have."

However, that's all the book provides. There are no strategies for self-protection, no tips to making oneself less attractive to criminals. The emphasis is on reacting to the threat of violence instead of proactively avoiding it.<p>It seems to be a common belief of American authors that there is an enormous net surrounding the United States which prevents their works from being read outside that country's borders. Mr. de Becker is a prime example. A reader living outside the US might find de Becker's assumptions annoying if not outright ludicrous.<p>This book may also not sit well with relatives of violent criminals. It is de Becker's belief that poor parenting is at the root of most violent crime. Few would disagree that poor parenting can cause a child to grow up antisocial or criminal, but so can many other things; heredity, war, abuse by someone in trust other than a parent, the death of a parent, divorce, or poverty."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","The blurb for the Gift of Fear is: your intuition is highly tuned to predict danger; it is worth listening to.		The value of listening to your intuition seems to go without savying, but it doesn't, we rationalize away our intuition.  We are uncomfortable judging someone else's alterior motives.  Our ideals tell us to give everyone a chance.  Our intuition tells us otherwise. De Becker tries to shock the reader with case studies from his practice to be more attentive to intuition and accept some people are evil. While we are ashamed to make accusations about the dark motives of others, refusing to do so disables your best protection system, your intuition.		Your intuition has been fine tuned by evolution to accurately intuit the motivation of others - the ability to deceive and detect deception are competitive advantages.  Turns out  there are universal methods of building trust; predators try to short circuit the process with techniques like forced teaming, too many detail, and unsolicited offers for help. The difference between harmless social clumminess and tactics of a predator are small, but are intuition is tuned to tell the difference. It feels forced, a little off.		We also dull our intuition by not separating worry from fear.  De Becker careful distingusihes the two - worry is general, it is not linked to a specific threat.  Fear can be traced to a threat - although it can take a deliberate review to understand what is making your intuition fire.		The more analytical parts of the book aren't included to replace your intuition, but to inform it.  Knowing the patterns can help your split second decision making, as de Becker says, the first step to getting the right answer is asking the right questions.  De Becker provides the JOCA - Justification, Options, Consequences, Ability - framework for aiding intuition in evaluating threats. Any change to the JOCA factors should trigger a reassess of the threat - it seems like this is how my intuition works, de Becker just codified it.		Another way to strengthen your intuition is to start seeing events as a chain - seemingly random events have predictable chains of events.  The best way to reduce danger is to, with the help of intuition, recognize the chain and to end things early. Rather than being confrontational, it is best to end with threats early - often ignoring or a gently letting them down early will avoid later, more threatening, confrontations.		The problems with the Gift of Fear is the uneven quality of the examples - especially the \"just so\" stories about the serendipity of following inution and success.  It also gets repetitive - there are many different threats discussed, but the warning signs are similar and the sections aren't writen to be read individually (you really need to read the whole book).  Removing repetition and including neuroscience and evolutionary psychology would improve the book."

About 3/4 of the way through the book, I started to wonder how accurate some of the information was and if it was possible to predict violent behavior using some of the methods described. The biggest thing I wondered about was if some of the generalized statements that the author made would be applicable to a specific incident. Then last week my wife had a situation at work that put her in what I believe to be a very dangerous situation. Some of the things that the perpetrator was saying and doing were almost exactly as described in the book. His methods to try to control the situation and get my wife to behave the way he wanted were exactly the same as those outlined in the book. Fortunately I had been telling my wife some about the book and she recognized what was happening and was able to prevent him from controlling the situation.

It's technically a self help book maybe? But really it should just be a good guide to common sense. If you are sending a child out into the world, you definitely want her to have read this first."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This is a great book.  As someone who has been involved in martial arts and personal defense for much of my life, I have read more books than I can count that treat this subject.  This is the best one.  De Becker knows his subject, and is able to paint a portrait of why we fear, and how we can not only embrace that reality, but turn it to our advantage.  It is neither overly pessimistic (drowning in the evils of the world), nor too rosy-cheeked in its analysis of this critical survival instinct.  Peppered with anecdotes and well-researched evidence, the book not only flows but flies, and most important of all it provides no-nonsense advice for many situations that are faced by those in danger.  A must read for anyone looking to understand their own fear, and how it can empower and protect them."

It is (unfortunately) truly a necessity for these times though...There is a ton of wisdom in this book, all expressed in a down to Earth, common sense kind of way.  Especially helpful is the list put together by Gavin DeBecker on signals to watch for such as \"loan sharking\" and refusal to hear the word no.  Some of the stories in it are really shocking (Michael Perry & some other heavy duty stalkers) as are some of the statistics sited (some 70 children - the majority of whom are under age 5 - are killed by their own parents EVERY WEEK!).		There is a lot of advice on how to deal with different situations & better yet most of the techniques can also be used in other difficult situations not covered in the book.  It's not a checklist of do's & don't though, much emphasis is placed on listening to your own intuition/inner voice/gut feeling or whatever, which is good, because we can't always carry the book around for any bad situation which may come up.  There is so much violence in our world...and this is pretty much a must read for anyone not living in an over-sheltered bubble."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This book was recommended to me by my ninjutsu instructor, who is also a US Marshall that deals with highly dangerous fugitives.  If you are considering this book, allow me to boil it down a little for you.  Think of how you can sleep in your own house, city or country, with all its unusual sounds, etc., and it won't bother you at all - you sleep right through it all - but if you travel somewhere else, it can be harder to sleep because you notice new sounds.  Or, you can have a loud noise next to you that you're used to, so you will sleep through it (like an alarm clock!), but you'll wake SHARPLY at the quietest creak of a floor board?  That *should* be counter-intuitive, right?  One is loud, the other is quiet?  DeBecker explains how the subconscious is processing something like (and I am misquoting him here I'm sure) 2000 things per minute when our conscious mind only does 50 (the ratio is similar even if the numbers are off - feel free to correct in comments if you recall the real numbers).  So, while you sleep, your subconscious was processing all those sounds as normal and not normal, and that loud ice machine (or alarm clock lol) is \"normal\" - it belongs there.  That floor board creaking oh so quietly?  NOT normal, wake the hell up NOW!		THAT - your subconscious' ability to process thousands of things we aren't even aware of, then GIVE US CLUES - is the \"gift of fear\".  What we struggle with as a society is knowing when it's that, and when it's just paranoia (hence the avoiding the news [or wrong/too much news] comments).		This book teaches you how to clear off the cobwebs and learn how to understand what your brain is telling you.  I'm EXTREMELY analytical and empirically-driven - YET - I have always had strong intuition, and it didn't make sense to me that a \"gut feeling\" could be so accurate when it didn't have \"empirical data\" to back it up.  It gives people like me who need to see a scientific reason for intuition just that - because it actually is simply a cause & effect of real processes.		There are so many astounding examples that I'd LOVE to put but I don't want to \"spoil\" the \"OMG no way!\" effect they had on me when I read them - so despite my enthusiasm, I will resist!  But the examples, though some upsetting, are really astounding.  To get the most of each, take each example and see if you can see how the principles apply.  Train your brain.		The reason I say this is helpful in more than just crime and violence is that the subconscious processes clues on more than just violence and danger.  It processes EVERYTHING.  Body language experts do this, for example.  The \"intuition\" aspect of this has also helped me in business and people relations, because I've opened myself up more to subconscious cues that I thought I was getting before but were \"silly\" - turns out they were NOT silly, and by learning how and when to listen, I make better decisions and actions.		If you really pay attention - maybe read this book twice! - this can really sharpen your skills in multiple areas.  This is a book I recommend to so many people for so many reasons."

The Gift of Fear reminds us that we have powerful neural processing to let us know when something is wrong and we can rely on it (and it works better if we don't try to overwhelm the intuition it provides with anxious false signals).  Also how to spot & deal with stalkers, and a ton of other good stuff.  Also other psychological insights into why people do what they do, synergistic with cited books such as Emotional Intelligence.

The Gift of Fear is an excellent example of how one has that \"gut feeling or instinct \" and how you can learn to utilize it to win the big game, the fight , or win back your very life...The Gift of Fear is a great book and now he has another titled Just 2 Seconds which I currently am reading.

This book is just as compelling as The Gift of Fear. Gavin de Becker is a pioneer in his industry and even more, a great writer. In the book, Gift of Fear Mr. de Becker speaks about listening to instincts and the reasons behind them. Furthermore, understanding future behaviors with current actions is addressed in the book in an in-depth manner.  Both books are written only as he could and it is certain that everyone should add them to their collection or home library.  The information is compelling so much so that you can not put these books down.		So far, JUST 2 SECONDS has drawn me in as he dissects the moments before an event.

I'm probably one of the youngest readers of The Gift of Fear, but Gavin de Becker's words empowered me just as much as they did the next person. I loved the book. It made me realize that I have to stop ignoring my body, my intuition. If you haven't read this book, go out and get it! It will teach you so many things.  This book should be required reading in high school, especially in girl's \"health\" classes. It is a practical, although at times scary, outline of the threats that can be around us. The layout is particularly good in that each chapter is a different specific threat. Too bad we live in a world like this, but this book can give one an edge.  The real life anecdotes blew me away. The account of the murdered woman who had reportedly suffered violence at the hands of the defendant for a long while. The calls to police, filing battery charges, lady killed by stabbing, defendant had a dream about killing her, his lawyers claiming it was drug dealers that committed murder. Sound familiar? DeBecker reveals that this true story happened six months before the famous \"white Bronco\" television event in a neighborhood thousands of miles from Brentwood. This book is too good NOT to read.  Ever since a couple of years ago, I knew I wanted to help people. I'm the person my friends come to when they have a conflict, I like giving advice and solving people's dilemmas. There was one problem: I didn't heed my own advice. I didn't listen to myself many times because I could picture people saying, \"Oh, that's a silly suspicion.\" Fortunately, I have never been in a situation in which I deeply regret ignoring my intuition, but after reading The Gift of Fear I have learned how to listen to myself. I also baby-sit. The other day I was holding one of the children, and he pointed to one of his brother's friends and whispered to me, \"I'm scared of him.\" I thought for a moment and replied, \"Well, you know what? That's OK.\" I told him that if he's ever afraid, he should leave where that person is and go find Mommy, or me, or someone he knows and doesn't feel afraid. I was proud that he listened to his intuition, but I think I was more proud of my response. I was totally psyched that I had reinforced something he needs to survive. My point is that The Gift of Fear taught me how to use my gift of intuition and my gift of fear. Read the book because you will learn from it; you will use the tactics everyday.  Gavin de Becker does an excellent job of sharing his experience in dealing with topics of understanding threats, predicting violence, workplace violence, stalking, domestic violence, and more. This book will shed new light in an area of our society where unwanted pursuits and violent behavior seem to be a part of our every day existence. Best of all, you will become more comfortable with every day life and you will use the wonderful treasures Mother Nature has given you because it was instilled in you by Gavin de Becker."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","It's obvious that De Becker has exceptional intelligence and excels at whatever he does, simply from the skill with which he wrote this book.  I especially like how he didn't mince words, led clearly from the topic of one chapter to another, and repeated over and over in different ways the central concepts of his book.		I do agree with previous reviewers' criticisms, such as his dubious statistics, his peculiarly nameless name-dropping (a famous film and recording star who was not only his client but a dear friend..?), and somewhat critical stance on guns.  But come on people.  Gavin de Becker is not going to take away your right to bear arms.		But the main premise of this book, listen to that intuitive fear signal and don't say, 'oh it's probably nothing,' is fantastic.  Also, why have I never seen the main elements of a con drawn out so clearly?  Forced teaming, too many details, charm, etc... this was very valuable to me, as was the opportunity to understand acts of violence from a point of view of prevention instead of the insane point of view that the news media takes.  Also I loved his criticism of the media, concrete evidence of how ridiculous most news stories are, and suggestion that we all take a break from the evening news.  I've been taking that break for about 10 years now.  Thanks Mr. De Becker!"

While this works for 95% of the people a woman will meet, when it fails, it fails big time.  At the very least, it will make a timid woman think about politeness vs. her safety.		A quick note: I recommended this to a friend, who said it would make his daughter afraid of men.  Give her this book in one hand with How to Lie With Statistics by Darrell Huff in the other (as Mr. de Becker seems to draw his numbers from somewhere strange - maybe international statistics? I don't know).  Teach her to take the good advice from this book (and others), and leave the bad stuff behind.  There is good information in this book; don't throw it all out.		The largest thing that I disliked about this book was the anti-gun stuff.  I am a woman and I own a SKS rifle, which I love.  I have plans to purchase a handgun when I can afford one.

DO NOT GO TO A MAN even if he is in uniform. Another thing I tell them and one I tell myself to avoid being a victim is, no strange man needs to ask for help or directions from a child or a woman he doesn't know.

I purchased this book as another resource for my safety instruction presentations I regularly provide to Fire and EMS personnel.  I have always had a very situationally aware personality and so I really didn't learn that much that I could personally apply in my life as far as making changes or alteration in my mindset.  What I did get from this book was validation of my way of doing business when it comes to personal encounters and especially on the job.  It's nice to be able to quote from a source for others to see when discussing my experiences and beliefs.		Mr. de Becker provides some excellent situations where countless people were beset by tragedy for not literally listening to their \"little voice\".  However, as the book progresses, Mr. de Becker takes a very serious turn toward politics and the advancement of Kalifornia-style firearms laws restricting the ownership, carrying, and storage of privately owned guns.  Up to this point, I can completely respect this views and experiences but it is at the point that he begins to advocate more laws to force law-abiding gun owners to do things that are contrary to the right to bear arms rather than being responsible for their actions as honorable people.  The first part of the book really puts a notion of personal responsibility onto people to keep themselves safe by using their intuition so I would ask why the need to apply laws where intuition and responsibility should also be applied--in owning a firearm.		It's unfortunate that this read is tarnished by politics but if you stop before you get there, the book is great.  If not for the politics, it would get five stars."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I had been wanting to read this book for years. I saw a segment on Oprah and valued what seemed to be practical advice--don't let societal pressure to \"be nice\" short circuit your God-given senses when they tell you something is wrong or that you are in danger.		My daughter found a copy at Titlewave in Anchorage (great used bookstore, shameless plug), and grabbed it for me because the copies fly out at soon as they come in. I am about 1/3 through. The writing style is pretty good, and the first few anecdotes are compelling, but the more I read the more disturbed I am by deBecker's use of statistical data. First and most important, anyone who reads this book should know that it was written 15 years ago or more and took a couple years to write, so that hard data quoted and demonstrating such a violent society only getting worse is terribly misleading. Readers can, and absolutely should, do quick check on the FBI website deBecker himself uses and get all the numbers they want to compare acts of violence and the general level of violence in America. The reality is that violent crime, in almost all its variants, is down by nearly half-get that:HALF-since 1992-1997, the time frame of the data stream used to construct the book. That is not to say that vigilance is not warranted, but rather that the belief that violence is a step outside the door is not either. Indeed, such paranoia seems to invalidate deBecker's own claims about the predictability of violence.		The update for this kindle edition promises to explore how technology enhances not only our lives, but the ability of perpetrators to do us harm, but it doesn't promise to offer any updated data or statistics. Do you suppose that may be because there is no incentive-job security and all that?	DeBecker alludes to a lot of top tier clients and interventions against stalkers and such. He doesn't include a curriculum vitae or credentials and education. He mentions counseling individuals and couples after violence has occurred, but not necessarily in a clinical sense. DeBecker has been successful in aligning himself with public security infrastructure (check out the wiki on MOSAIC), which bolster his credibility, but while in use for 20+ years the system apparently has not been independently verified for effectiveness.		I am trying to decide if I will finish the book. I kinda think I have the gist of the most important parts of use to me: Listen to your intuition, even or especially when it seems to put you on alert against a seemingly neutral situation; better to be rude than dead; minimize risk by avoiding knowingly risky situations or risky people; if someone shows they have the capacity for violence or the will to threaten violence, get out NOW!!!, don't wait or think you can change the person; on that note, the playground rule of \"ignore the bully\" still seems pretty valid, as much as it runs counter to our desire to assert our own power over someone trying to take it from us.

Some man that victimized women started THAT rule in our culture.  This is a GREAT book with very real insight into how to listen to your automated response cycles - your body senses things long before you \"think\" about them and we may be technologically advanced but listing to that gut feeling is important because as people often point out; it is never wrong!<p>Most victims of violent crime will tell you when looking back that if they had not been engaging in politeness or rationalization that there were warning signs of the impending violence that they ignored.  In no way does this mean that victims are responsible for what happens to them.  Instead this is a good guide to returning to lisening to our instincts.  Humans are the only animal that participate in our own victimization.  DeBecker says it himself in \"Protecting the Gift\"  ( A MUST READ FOR PARENTS ) that a gazelle will run when there is a lion - not try to tell herself that maybe THIS lion is a NICE lion.

(given too much information to a stranger?  gotten on an elevator  with someone even though you felt uncomfortable)?

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","The book concentrates largely on threat assessment, de	Becker's specialty--reading behavoral cues to gauge how likely someone	will be to initiate violence.  It deals to a lesser extent with how to	 handle people that your assessment tells you are going to be a	 problem.  De Becker systematically goes through cases where violence	 aparrently came &quot;out of the blue&quot; and demonstrates that in each	 situation, there were plenty of danger signals, and that the victim's	 intuition had already registered these signals and communicated them	 as feelings of uneasiness.  People invariably knew that	 something was out of place, but ignored the feelings.  The book goes	 on to inform the reader's intuition with an analytical breakdown of	 danger signals in different environments: from strangers, stalkers,	 angry employees, controlling spouses, obsessive fans, and people who	 deliver death threats.  The bottom line for de Becker is &quot;listen to	 your gut-level intuition&quot;; people usually have a pretty acute sense	 of when they are truly at risk.		 <p>The book's biggest shortcoming is that it deals only with the	 above situations--where the potential aggressor is known to the	 victim, or some kind of seduction is present before violence is	 initiated.  On page 61 de Becker writes:		 <p>&quot;I haven't focused here on the criminal who simply walks	 up, displays a weapon, and demands money.  That is because he is	 distinctly more obvious that those who use the strategies I've	 described&quot;		 <p>	 And with that farewell he abandons fifty percent of the violent crimes	 in America to concentrate on the ones where threat assessment might	 make a more substantial difference in the outcome.  This can	 unfortunately leave the reader with the impression that all crime is	 avoidable, when in fact, the cases that don't fit his profiles	 (interpersonal contact with victim precedes violence) haven't even	 been discussed.  Conspicuously absent are:		 <p>		 1. Any evaluation, pro or con, of firearms or other self-defense	 precautions for personal protection, though indirectly he	 recommends IMPACT associates, who provide self-defense training for	 women.  This omission is unfortunate, because &quot;get a gun&quot; is	 oft-quoted counsel for people at risk, and de Becker's perspective could make a difference.		 <p>		 2. Any analysis of victim selection in predatory crime, or	 suggestions for avoiding appearing &quot;victimizable.&quot;  The latter is a	 particularly unfortunate omission, since the perceived vulnerability	 of a victim is a significantly influential factor in whether or	 not they will be selected for violence, and it is something that	 people can take definite action about.<p>		 <p> The book is also remarkably short on suggestions about what to do	 once you know someone means you ill.  In only three scenarios does de	 Becker have a set of proactive recommendations: firing an angry	 employee, leaving an abusive spouse, and cutting off communications	 with persistent or obsessive callers.  His recommendations in these	 cases are excellent, but in the rest of his examples (stalkings,	 children known to be at sexual risk, violent assaults by	 strangers, burglars in the house, credible death threats, persistent	 violations of restraining orders, recreational assaults by teenagers)	 he has very little to say beyond identifying risk factors.  As my wife	 pointed out, his primary, and recurring, scenario (that of Kelly, who,	 knowing that she was going to be killed if she followed a rapist's	 instructions to stay put, instead silently followed him down the	 hallway and let herself out the door) is a fantasy of non-violent	 conflict resolution.  Far more common is the situation where the	 threat is known, but options are uncertain.  De Becker investigates	 the situations where neighbors say &quot;We had no idea; we would have	 never suspected,&quot; but pays little attention to the countless	 situations where the neighbors were expecting it all along, had known	 for years that there was going to be trouble, and who it was going to come	 from.		 <p> Because the fundamental conclusion of the book is correct: people	 usually do have an accurate and powerful sense of their own	 risk.  If you go for a ride with the LAPD, they know who the	 drug dealers and gangbangers and chronic offenders are, and often have	 a good idea of who their victims will be.  What to do about it--now,	 there's a more difficult issue.		 <p>That said, I think this book is looking in the right direction:	 victim empowerment.  It's not a book for law enforcement or	 professional security agencies--it's a book written for the individual	 at risk.  It emphasizes that you are the person who makes the	 difference in your own security--especially in situations where the	 probable aggressor is someone you know.  It encourages people not to	 participate in their own victimization, and repeatedly shows that in	 critical moments in the commission of crimes, you are the only person	 who can make the difference.  His information on threat assessment is	 excellent, written with the honest intention of giving the reader	 enough intelligence to take to recognize risk when they see it and to	 take proactive steps toward their own security. I highly recommend	 this book to anyone with an interest.		 <p>Other recommended reading: John Douglas, _Mindhunter_, and	 Robert Ressler _Whoever Fights Monsters_ (on the FBI's profiling of	 serial criminals); Paxton Quigley, _Not an Easy Target: A Women's	 Guide to Self-Protection_ (on victim selection and pragmatic threat	 avoidance); Linden Gross, _To Have and to Harm: True Stories of	 Stalkers and their Victims_."

The trouble is there is no such sentence or sentiment in my book.  On his basic concern about media and sdministration use of fear to cause hysteria, I agree entirely.  My most recent book, FEAR LESS, is all about that topic, taking the media to task for its role in creating unwaranted fear, and all by books suggest that readers NOT watch televison news.  So, Mr. Jones, if you ever do read The Gift of Fear, which is about the useful roles of intuition and fear in our lives, you'll find an ally, and I'll look forward to your review as a reader.  For now, here's a quote that actually is in my book, at the end, in a discussion about how modern life can seem to be \"a high-stakes obstacle course our ancestors would shudder at, but the fact is we are usually delivered through it.  Still, rather than be amazed at the wonder of it all, millions of people are actually looking for things to worry about.		 Near the end of his life, Mark Twain wisely said, \"I have had a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.\"		  You now know a great deal about predicting and avoiding violence, from the dangers posed by strangers to the brutality inflicted on friends and family members, from the everyday violence that can touch anyone to the extraordinary crimes that will touch only a few.  With your intuition better informed, I hope you will have less unwarranted fear of people.  I hope you'll harness and respect your ability to recognize survival signals.

I am 32 years old and have had three stalking experiences.  Two were mild...one was severe.  I foolishly thought that, because I had survived those incidences, I was an expert in having it NOT happen again.  As I read Gavin's book, I saw more and more that, not only was I clueless about how to protect myself, I was STILL making the same mistakes that landed me with stalkers to begin with.<p>I was brought up in a world where you respect others and are always kind and courteous.  There *are* benefits to being kind and courteous.  But I was doing it in the wrong situations.  I would be approached by a man that had I had no interest in.  Instead of telling him firmly and forcefully that I was NOT interested, I would smile and let them know that was really flattered and, well, who knows what the future would bring.  In other words, I always tried to let them down easy.  And so they would come back again and again.  This was a pattern that happened over and over in my life.<p>My most serious stalking incident happened over ten years ago.  Yet this person STILL contacts me.  However, in the early years I handled it all wrong.  My boyfriend at the time contacted him telling him to leave me alone.  First I would hang up on him when he called.  Next I had my number changed.  Gavin's book showed me that everything I did to handle the situation could have potentially made the situation worse (it did!).  I was threatened, harassed, made to constantly look over my shoulder.  I can see now that I should have simply ignored the problem - not had anyone contact my stalker, not changed my number but instead have kept the number and just gotten an additional line.  For the past 7 years, I have stopped reading the emails that this sick man sends me (I simply save them to a folder...unread).  I never acknowledge his existence.  That was the *only* right thing I have done in this situation.<p>Now that I have read this book, I feel better prepared to handle situations like have happened in the past.  I will be firm in my `no's!' and unwavering in my speech.  This book has helped me learn the tricks of the trade.  I am *not* a professional counselor.  I am just a person who has had a rough time in the past with people wanting to take advantage of a female's kindness.  Thanks to this book, I am far better prepared to handle situations in the future.<p>I think everyone should read this book.  And everyone should give a copy to their loved ones.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","A few days after I finished reading \"The Gift of Fear\" I was standing in check out line at the library.  The female librarian was dealing with a male customer who was not checking out a book.  I overheard him using manipulative lines on the librarian right out of DeBecker's book!  After he finally left, I asked the librarian if the man was bothering her.  She said that he had been coming into the library for weeks, doing the same thing.  She was an alert woman, and had taken a few precautions coming to and leaving work, and warned other library employees not to give the man any information about her,  but was continuing to be harassed at her work by this man.  I suggested that she read this book.  When I thought about the situation, I realized how often I have observed and experienced disturbing men doing the exact behaviors in the book.  One example of manipulation from the book that really sticks in my mind is the 40-year-old man who uses several gambits to engage a teenage girl on a plane in an inappropriate way.  I won't go into details, but if you read this book, I think you will get a chill reading this passage, as I did.  Another very thought-provoking section that hit home was about hiring and firing of employees.  Mr. DeBecker's tips on proper hiring techniques and careful and considerate firing practices seem like common sense, but are seldom practiced in the work place.  I am sure a lot of revenge situations are actually brought on by the victim insulting the troublesome individual and practically forcing him to retaliate.  DeBecker's story of the harmless fan who was transformed into a horrific stalker was a perfect example.  Although a little long, this book is both interesting and sure to be very useful."

The book has received much publicity from many of places.  But unfortunately, many people still think the book is for women (particularly single women) only.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<p>The whole premise of `The Gift of Fear' is that each of us has a little voice inside of us that warns us of danger from others.  Animals have it too.  But unlike animals, we often seek to suppress our warning signals, thinking \"This guy's harmless, what am I thinking?\" or \"He's just asking to come inside for a glass of water.  What's the harm in that?\" or \"I can't ignore him.  That would be rude.  I don't want to appear rude.\"  <p>Every day people ignore the danger signals that are given off in response to those who mean to do us harm.  De Becker shows us how and why this happens.  The situations are endless:  robbers, thieves, stalkers, disgruntled employees, former lovers/friends, even murderers.  De Becker tells us how to recognize the danger signals and how NOT to ignore them.  He also tells us how to deal with people who could endanger us, how to put a stop to threats, and why most restraining orders not only don't work, but usually work to the detriment of the one requesting the order.  <p>Yes, this is an extremely important book for all women to read, but don't stop there.  Every man and woman should this book, especially if you have a family.  Reading `The Gift of Fear' will not guarantee that you will be completely free from danger for the rest of your life, it goes an awful long way towards that goal.  Very highly recommended."

A lot of the things he mentions sounds like common sense but when you're in that situation it's easy to get off-track, next thing you know you aren't listening to yourself and you become a victim.  I also liked how he doesn't make you scared to leave your house, he just allows you to be aware, proactive about your own safety.  It's excellent and women of all ages should read it...or listen to it."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This is one of the best and most important books I have ever read, and you--whether you're young or old, have kids or no kids, are male or female--should absolutely read it. Actually, if you're a woman, I would particularly insist that you read it.		One of the primary goals of the book is to help the reader learn to tell the difference between worry/anxiety and fear. Real fear is a survival signal, one that we all have, and it's amazingly powerful and helpful if we listen to it. By the end of the book, I felt a lot more confidence in myself, and I spend far less time being anxious in some situations (parking garages are the prime example): because I know what to pay attention to and what questions to ask myself, I don't waste energy and sanity worrying about all the things that could possibly happen and instead live in the present, calm and collected.		Also, aside from how much I learned from the book, it's a really interesting read.		I cannot recommend this book more highly. Find it, and read it!"
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I had heard and read about this book, so I finally made myself read it. Overall, it is a good resource, although a little too limited, especially given the sheer number of pages.		What's good:		- If you feel sudden fear in an unfamiliar situation, trust it. This is good advice and the author gives some examples where trusting or mistrusting this fear had good or bad consequences for the person involved. Human intuition has been honed over millennia and can pinpoint something weird much faster than conscious thought can. In fact, apparently if your dog barks at a person while you talk to him, the dog is reading your body cues (because your human intuition is richer) rather than judging the other person directly.	- List of behaviors that strangers and con artists use to gain your trust, and how to reject them.	- List of questions to ask at your child's school about their security measures, and what to ask potential babysitters.	- How to deal with stalkers and abusive spouses (in a nutshell, remove yourself from the interaction ASAP).	- How to fire problem employees.	- Some insights into how various types of criminals think and how they are after all human and one can read their motivations.	- Reinforces the importance of good parenting with some chilling examples of parental failure.	- Spells out the difference between fear and anxiety and suggests ways to reduce anxiety.	- Covers well the social engineering side of (unorganized) violent crime.		What's bad:		- Tons of self-promotion and name dropping. The author has a celebrity protection company and works with leading law enforcement agencies since his clients are high profile. He makes this clear on every page of the book.	- Covers reasonably well only the cases where violence is most obvious and predictable, e.g. child abuse or spousal abuse.	- Does not provide actionable advice on what to do when faced with danger, besides the obvious \"trust your fear\". Perhaps he means to say, get the hell out of there, but that is not spelled out.	- Insists that violence is always predictable, and the opinion to the contrary (plus being extra aware or prepared) is wrong. Yes, in cases where once can observe the potentially violent person, such as inside families or at work, I would agree with the author. However, in the US there is a surprising number of public place shootings where most of the attendees would have no idea that violence would be coming until it is upon them.	- Contradicts himself when describing a high profile manhunt for a serious criminal, which unexpectedly reveals the lairs of two other stalkers close to his customer's residence, even though de Becker and his firm are supposed to be routinely on top of these threats. So things are not as clear and predictable after all?		Overall recommended. That said, there are other good books on this topic out there, and after reading this one, learn also about ways to protect yourself and loved ones."

Not only did it give me the ammunition to function in my daily life with out the fear of danger, I was able to use it's resources to improve my own life and all the relationships in it.

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This is the third time I've read The Gift of Fear.  It was recommended to me years ago by a friend of mine after I told her about a strange incident I experienced and my reaction to it.  She had me read the book and told me my experience wasn't strange, it was my \"gut\" and it probably saved my life.  I've read the book twice in paperback and I downloaded the Kindle version the other day and re-read it.		Awhile ago, my daughter and I had a heated debate about this book; she said the author was blaming the victims for their plight but I countered that you stand a better chance of not becoming a victim (or less of one) if you pay attention to your intuition. I'm not sure if she and I ever came to consensus on our disagreement but this I know for sure: I have had at least two occasions where I subconsciously made a change and in hindsight, realized I may have avoided danger.  I believe Mr. de Becker does a fine job distinguishing \"intuitive fear\" from \"self-created worry\" and how the constant anxiety wears down the intuitive fear reflex.		No one wants to be a victim, but burying your head into the sand and believing it only happens to other people isn't the answer.  You don't want to be hyper-vigilant with your nerves on edge but you also don't want to be clueless.  Just acknowledging that the pre-incident indicators are real is a start and recognizing them if they appear can make all the difference.  I still have the paper version and now with the Kindle, I have a mobile version with me when I travel..		This is not a novel, it's a must-read safety manual so take your time, read, highlight important text and learn; it could save your life."

The book focused primarily on listening to one's instincts, and then went into more specifics of the behaviors of dangerous people. It was an interesting exercise to think through some of the situations listed in the book and understand the factors that were in play.		I think the book is valuable both to people who find themselves dealing with violence, and also for people who do not expect to be in that situation. It really made me think about a lot of \"accepted knowledge\" and strategies for one's daily life.		My one criticism of the book is that it at times it seemed to veer a little into the territory of advertising the author's security service firm.

While much of the book deals with things we as individuals may never to have to face, such as a celebrity stalker or sudden abduction, I found the chapters on dating violence incredibly insightful: I cannot say this enough.		This book carefully details how to look for violent tendencies, or the controlling tendencies that lead to violence. It details the manipulations that violent or controlling men use (controlling men can be emotionally abusive in addtion to, or as opposed to, physically violent, but is also harmful). It gives specific examples of warning signs that show who these men are so that we can avoid them in the first place.		As I said, I may never have to worry about being famous or grabbed in a parking lot, but I have used this invaluable book to safely deal with creepy neighbors, potential dates, and co-workers or subordinates that send off bad signals.

De Becker wants his readers to understand that true fear is a gift of our biological makeup, an ability to sense and react to danger even before we are consciously aware of it.  Those warnings are all too often ignored or suppressed, leading a depressing number of people into perilous and even deadly circumstances.  De Becker takes an unflinching look at human nature, and suggests we do the same, in the interests of our own self-protection.		At the same time, De Becker is anxious that to reinforce the concurrent lesson that unwarranted fear is a curse, that we waste time worrying about dangers that are remote or that we can do nothing about.  This even-handed approach keeps \"The Gift of Fear\" from turning into another alarmist expose about the hazards of modern life, and places it firmly in the realm of information likely to be useful to every reader.		\"The Gift of Fear\" is perhaps overly long, as De Becker cites a long string of examples from his personal and working life to reinforce his key points, but this long recitation may be necessary to drive home his lessons.  \"The Gift of Fear\" is very highly recommended to every reader who expects to have to live in the modern world."

Wow, talk about revisionist history, just the opposite is true of course, they would be horrified at how many of us simply allow ourselves to be sheep when the wolves come calling.<p>One of his typical anti-gun storys has to do with a complete moron who kept an unsecured weapon that was inaccessible to everyone but the intruder. The intruder of course locates the weapon and is then confronted by our moron. He is then held with his daughters for over an hour. The intruder finally leaves after deciding to not kill them (how sweet). Moral of the story is of course weapons will be used against us so lets get rid of all the weapons, silly. <p>Two other possibilties exist of course. 1st the intruder is confronted by our moron, neither is armed, confrontation would most definetely have ensued with unknown results but likely the street tuff would have beaten his brains in. 2nd moron actually has his gun and confronts the intruder, intruder is stopped (killed) or arrested and cannot confront and or harm any other familys at least until De Beckers liberal pals let him out a few years later. Now of these three possibilites which would you want to bet your life on? Mr. De Becker picks the sheep scenario for you, but for him and his clients it's armed body guards, otherwords other people defending you is ok, you defending you is just stupid so dont even try.<p>Read the book, but don't buy into his view that the only answer to violence is to recognize and avoid, those are very good tools to have, usually the best if possible, but also be ready to respond when or if you can't avoid violence.<p>I have had personal experience with a handgun that twice stopped crimes. Once a break and enter by a hopped up druggy who got sent packing by a 100lb women, later it turned out he was also an off and on again rapist among other things. One other time personally to stop a beating of an old man by a group of thugs. <p>Of course I am trained, experienced and more than willing to put a lot of lead through anyone that wants to live by the sword, also trained in hand to hand, and edged weapons. I spent moeny and time learning it and having the training and means to protect myself makes me less, not more likely to engage people with vilolence since I understand it and the consequences it can bring.<p>If you are a moron like De Beckers pal who had no training or will to repsond and thought the mere presence of a weapon would prevent violence then like him it would probably just be better to drop your pants, bend over and take whatever the world dishes out."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I got about 40 pages into this book before I tossed it.  As an avide reader of survival books I really expected this book to offer an in depth look at some of the challenges faced with confronting dangerous situations.  This book was about women surviving rape encounters and how not to let stangers into your apartment building.		The author comes off as cocky and bragging and it doesn't translate into a good read, for me at least.		The part that made me toss the book was when the author described how he made three guesses as to his waiter's background while dinning at a resteraunt.  He stated that he guessed the guy's nationality, the fact that his waiter was the owner, and that his waiter's family had owned a chain of resteraunts.  Guess what! He was correct!  Imagine being so good that you can tell which waiter owns the resteraunt you are eating at and that his family owns a bunch of them!  What instinct.		You may like this book, as obviously some people do, but do yourself a favor and read a few pages before you purchase or face making the mistake that I made."

What I got was a diatribe about what a terrifying world we live in, backed up by statistics that the author doesn't bother to back up or provide sources for in any way.  And many of the statistics that the author recklessly spews are easy to look up and falsify!  I guess that Mr. De Becker forgot that discerning, responsible readers could use a simple search engine to fact check his claims about the numbers of sexual assaults, rapes, murders, etc and find them to be very, very wrong.  Mr. De Becker appears to have just made up the numbers induce &#34;fear&#34; in his readers.	If you buy Mr. De Becker's book you will be the victim of crime, the crime of fraud!  And Mr. De Becker is the perpetrator."
"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","I don't use the word \"evil\" lightly, but I found myself in its presence early in \"The Gift of Fear.\" Security consultant Gavin de Becker is interrogating a woman who narrowly survived a recent three-hour rape. He wants to know if her attacker gave off any signs that, in de Becker's mind, should have notified the victim of the upcoming attack. \"I've learned some lessons about safety through years of asking people asking people who've suffered violence, 'Could you have seen this coming?' Most often they say, 'No, it just came out of nowhere,' but if I am quiet, if I wait a moment...\" At first, the woman says \"no,\" but de Becker knows that really means \"yes\"; eventually, his frightened, traumatized victim relents, obliging his need for her to self-incriminate.		In other words: de Becker seeks out scared and vulnerable women in the lowest point of their lives to convince them that they were responsible for their own rapes.		I first encountered \"The Gift of Fear\" via a popular blogger who talked up the book in the same way Scientologists talk about Dianetics. I hit up the Amazon entry for information, but I instead encountered torrents of disturbing misogyny from reviews and comments by the book's devotees - enthusiastic claims of how, say, Nicole Brown deserved to be murdered for not leaving O.J. (overlooking that fact that she *had* left him at the time of her death; once a filthy whore who needs to die, always such, I guess). I was repulsed and puzzled; what about this book held that blogger in utter thrall - how did it lead so many strangers to cheer a woman's death?		The book has exactly two good points:		a) Don't let someone steamroll you with niceness into doing something you don't want, particularly if they're a stranger. Assert yourself and leave the area if need be. Don't let fear of being judged \"rude\" overwhelm your better judgment.		b) If you're being stalked, it's imperative to cut off completely all contact with the stalker. This includes contact meant to tell the other party that you don't want any more contact. The alternative, in a twisted way, gives the stalker what s/he wants - a relationship with you, even if it's an adversarial one.		The problem is, though, that de Becker regards these tips not as possibly helpful advice but as absolute fail-safes. In de Becker's world, rapes are always break-ins committed by strangers and always _always_ signposted beforehand by observable tells that allow a would-be victim time for evasive action; therefore, if anyone does get raped, well, that's only their just desserts because they didn't follow the rules. But what if you're assaulted by a supposed friend or family member? What if you're date-raped or slipped a roofie? What if you're just overpowered? Hey, only a *slut* would ask those questions. This worldview leads to unfortunate episodes like de Becker blaming a stalking victim for an office shooting committed by her attacker that killed seven people - she shouldn't have made him mad by filing a restraining order.		I checked out at the point where de Becker began demanding a Medal of Honor for espousing the old saw that battered women are _volunteers,_ not _victims_; I figured I'd served my time. I skimmed the rest. While it has the couple aforementioned useful tips, the victim-blaming and unrealistic ideas behind the book more than negate any positive impact it would have in preventing sexual violence. If you must peruse the useful bits of de Becker's advice, limit yourself to chapter 4, the part on assertiveness. Just remember to wash afterward."

"10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.14","Signals for Survival (DVD)","0440508835","This book offers guidance on acting in dangerous interpersonal situations, and, far more importantly, how to detect warning signs--minutes to years in advance--and act on them.  For its main tenet is that violent crimes, from date stalking that goes unannounced every day to assassinations that grip the world, rarely occur out of the blue.  Some behaviors that may not seem alarming, from excessive enthusiasm about a business relationship to being the brunt of dark jokes, can be good indicators of a person's trajectory toward violence.  And then there are events like bomb threats, which seem more dangerous than they usually are.  Here we learn how to spot the signs, analyze the situation and act in ways that can reduce or eliminate the danger.  This information could possibly have prevented the Virginia Tech shootings--the foreshadowing of which is only now being acknowledged--along with countless other crimes in homes, businesses and streets.		Drawing on many real-life examples, DeBecker uses common sense, astute analogies and a keen understanding of human psychological workings to provide a lucid, practical and deeply empowering book.  Though his tone is serious and unafraid to describe the brutalities humans can afflict on each other, The Gift of Fear is very readable and sometimes even enjoyable.  I hope you don't find yourself in many of the situations described...but you will be better prepared to face them if they come.		*Edit: the 1-star rating was a slip of the mouse.

I liked the reminder that we should all be aware of our intuition.  If something feels wrong, there is probably a reason, and we shouldn't ignore these feelings.  I think that it's always useful to have a reminder to be aware of our environment and the people in it, and it's also good to have a reminder that certain horrific scenarios, such as random kidnapping, are much less likely than the media would have us believe.		However, much of this book simply wasn't relevant to my life.  As a series of anecdotes about the rich and famous, or a \"day in the life\" memoir of a security expert, it was very interesting.  As a book that would help me in specific situations I may encounter, it wasn't as helpful as I would have hoped.

The 'introduction' is only five pages long, yet it gives you what you need to use the book and to sort out the 'basic body types' of so many birds. You may find that even the ELBBs of Europe are charming to spot.		ELBBs?  \"Elusive Little Brown Birds\" of course. But you'll be surprised, through your binoculars, at how many of them are not brown after all."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","This is just simply a wonderful field guide, and definitely the best bird book for European species. I also own the RSPB guide to British birds which I picked up on the fly in the UK; however, I chose to leave that behind in favor of Mullarney et al. when I relocated to Germany. The descriptions, field marks, and pictures are wonderful. It also has pictures and descriptions of both males, females and juveniles, which my other book didn't have for all species, much to my dismay (at least 1 instance for a sexually dimorphic species). It's also relatively compact making it easier to carry in the field. The ordering of the songbirds is a little different from Sibley, but this is easy to adjust to. This certainly is a must have for all birders that might be traveling to Europe."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","It's a wonderful guide, with simple explanations and beautiful images.	For amateurs and ornitologists."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","This is a wonderful bird book. The descriptions are excellent, the illustrations wonderful. But I ended up taking the not-as-good Peterson Guide to Europe recently because-this book is very heavy for a field guide. When you are doing trans-continental travel weight matters. I hope they reissue this book at some point but in a format the drops some of the weight. I used it to study and confirm information on my spottings when I got home, but had to eliminate it from my baggage when I started trimming items to get a more reasonable weight."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","Written in English for bird watchers in Europe, this has all sorts of practical information for identifying and understanding the birds in all of Europe."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","This is a comprehensive and detailed bird book.  However, the range maps are very small and hard to read.  The text occasionally sounds patronizing and often doesn't seem to describe behavior very effectively.  I really like Sibley for North American birds, and I wish there were a Sibley for Europe because this book wasn't as good as I think a Sibley would have been."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","Moving to Europe, most of the flora and fauna are new to me.  This book helped me figure out the identity of a number of birds I see every day: crows, wrens, sparrows, magpies and others.  It confirmed the identity of water birds: coots, egrets, great blue herons and of course mallards.  And though I have yet to see one, it let me know for sure that I have heard a European cookoo.  Well done. Good diagrams, distribution maps, and descriptions of habits and appearance."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","This book was recommended to me by an avid birder.  I'm not as obsessive as some, but I do like to know what I'm looking at, and I do keep a life list.  What I like most about this field guide is the Identification text.  The authors include ALL relevant information, not just color and size.  If it's important, they include the habitat preferences, variations in birds of different ages, behavioral characteristics, etc.  There is also a description of \"Voice\" for most species.		The illustrations are excellent, if a bit small.  For example, in the section on hawks, there are illustrations of birds perched in different postures, as well as soaring, gliding and wing shape when flapping.  Notes and pointers indicate key identification \"field marks\" on the illustrations.		One down-side to this resource is that it uses strictly European nomenclature, and it sometimes takes me a while to make the translation in my mind.  For example, birds known as jaegers in the United States are called skuas in this guide.  I believe this guide is a valuable reference for any birder's home library, and essential to any birder who travels outside North America."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","I think that this is the best book for bird-watching in Europe.  It is also translated in other languages, (maybe with different title)"

"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","Please note that all reviews prior to February 2010 concern the first edition. However, much of what has been said for that first edition holds for the new one as well. Also, this book is exactly the same as the so called \"Collins\" Field Guide to Britain and Europe, issued in the UK. The Princeton version is both cheaper, and it has a more appropriate name.		At any rate, the long awaited second edition of this excellent field guide is finally here. Improving on the world's best bird field guide is almost certainly a task that will disappoint a few. However, the authors and illustrators are to be commended for their achievement. Despite an addition of almost fifty pages, compared to the first edition, this is still a very field-worthy book. The text, range maps, and many illustrations have been throughly revised and updated. Particularly noteworthy are the many new owl illustrations, and the page of \"Atlantic\" pigeons. Many \"new\" species have been added due to splits from previous subspecies. Thus, many island races  from the Canary Islands are now full species. Some taxonomic groups got a particular revision, such as the wheatears and the \"Herring Gull complex\". The treatment of the latter has been expanded from less than a double page to three full spreads. With Caspian Gull being fully illustrated in various plumages, for example. The taxonomic sequence got some changes in the first parts of the book, with geese and ducks now at the front. The same confusing fashion as in field guides of North America and many other areas of the world. There is actually no need for a field guide to follow the latest taxonomic insights. Rather, there needs to be a sequence that allows for quickly finding a group of birds. And that would be best served if the basic sequence were kept constant.		Unfortunately, non-native species got a rather worse coverage than in the first edition. Some were relegated to the back of the book such as the locally well established Wood Duck and Mandarin Duck. And even for the European native Ruddy Shelduck, the range presumably due to human releases is not shown on the map. Personally, I consider such omissions a lack of recognizing reality. The same problems, unfortunately, are found in such leading works as the Handbook of the Birds of the World, and likewise for the mammal equivalent.		A welcome change in the range maps is the use of more detailed regional maps for very localised species.  Despite the time span of about ten years since the first edition, and the repeated postponement in the publication of this edition for about two years, it seems that there must have been a certain rush at the end. Thus, there are relatively many typos or other minor oversights. No big thing, but somewhat of a bother nevertheless. Hopefully, a large part will be corrected in subsequent printings.		Despite the various points I have criticized here, the book fully merits its five stars. It is just SO good! However, if you already own the first edition, and you use it mainly for local birding, you might want to just keep that edition for the moment."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","It's been a long wait: over the years I've placed orders for this book at amazon.com, amazon.co.uk, and a couple of different bookstores; amazon.ca finally came through for me less than two weeks after the second edition was released in the US--just when I was about to break down and order it from the UK. So I can't blame Canada.	And the wait was worth it. From the publication of the first edition a dozen years ago, there has been no serious debate about the unsurpassed quality of this guide, and the new edition is even better than its predecessor. \"Progressive\" taxonomies are taken into account in many groups--gulls and the gray shrikes spring to mind as obvious examples--and the sequence of species has been updated to begin with the waterfowl. Many birds, even whole plates, have been repainted; a first look-through finds the new figures invariably an improvement.	The only disappointments, mild ones at that, are instances where text space is used to tell the reader that an identification \"requires specialized knowledge.\" Why not instead at least hint at what that \"specialized knowledge\" is? Similarly, the plate captions for American Herring Gull mention the importance of close observation of the primary pattern in adults, without telling us precisely what we should be looking for and at. An enduring problem is the several instances of poor translation; the Great Gray Owl captions, for example, are full of instances where the translator's verbum pro verbo rendering produces an incomprehensible English text.	And as long as I'm carping, let me reveal my age with a complaint about the size of that text. I cannot read it without a magnifying glass, and my guess is that I'm not alone. But the glass reveals wonders: compare the accounts in this book and in Sibley or Nat Geo for any species found in both North America and western Europe, and prepare to be amazed by how very much more information is provided here. This book and its authors still set the standard for field guides, and any birder, in any location, will learn a huge amount from it."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","I was going to Europe on a trip where I would be doing some birdwatching, and bought this book based on reviews on Amazon. The book turned out to be great! Each bird has a comprehensive description with details on identification and distinguishing it from other birds with a similar appearance or bird call. Each also has an illustration with the birds in multiple poses, M/F, adult/young, and other features such as common surroundings which was very helpful. There's no quick-key by color - birds are arranged by groups rather than color - but I found this to be a minor inconvenience weighed against the wealth of info in this book."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","This is the best field guide for Europe, according to most birdwatchers. I completely agree.		But when I compaire it with the best field guide for northern America, the Sibley guide to birds, I cannot give it 5 stars.		The Sibley guide as better drawings and gives more details. Also the cover and the construction of the book is more practical. It would get 5 stars if \"Birds of Europe\" came in compairable quality as the \"Sibley guide to birds from publisher A.A.Knopf New York\""
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","When you're holding this little piece of excellent craftsmanship, detail and information it's not difficult to find out why it is considered one of the best field guides in the world.		This is the American version of the book (exact same content, different publisher. The original one is from Collins publishers) in its new, revised second edition. If you're looking for a field guide to the birds of Europe (and beyond!), look no more. This field guide is just...plain...AWESOME.		Note: This field guide covers much more than just Europe and Iceland. It also covers all of Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, West Bank (Palestinian authority) and Jordan, plus the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt), and all of Northern Africa that is 30º North (extreme northernmost Morocco, northern Algeria, all of Tunisia, extreme northernmost Libya, and extreme northernmost Egypt north of Cairo or Nile delta). In addition, it covers all of Russia west of the Ural mountains (a little farther, actually--up to the mainstream of the Ob river east of the Ural mtns.,about 65º E). It also covers north Atlantic islands near Europe/North Africa, such as the Azores, Madeiras, Canaries and Selvages.		Now to the review:		First of all, the basic organization and layout of the book is clear and easy to use--no flipping through field guide plates to text to maps. The illustrations are on one side and the text directly on the other. However, unlike most field guides that use this layout, the text is much more lengthy and informative. The maps are found directly below the text.		As for the illustrations, they are like nothing I've ever seen before. They aren't extremely detailed, allowing the birds to look alive and realistic. In addition, practically every plumage is shown, including variations and subspecies. Arrows and text point out distinctive field marks, behavior and other important characteristics. But the most amazing thing is that 85% of the time they show you a drawing of the bird in the distance in its natural habitat, just the way you'd see it in the field.		The text is very informative. Field marks are described in italics in order for one to find them easily. It also provides the bird's population/range status (abundant, common, uncommon, rare, vagrant, etc.). Note: The type is somewhat small, but unless you have eye problems this shouldn't be a problem (if you do have eye problems, you may want to purchase the large format edition published by Collins, or use a magnifying glass).		Towards the end of the book there are several lists of rarities or vagrants that have made their way to the area, even if they have been recorded only once.		What could be improved on:		Overall, this field guide is absolutely awesome and a must for every birder--even if you don't live in Europe. However, I believe the introduction could be a little lengthier and the maps and type a little bit larger. The other thing is that it would be useful if political country lines were shown, but the problem isn't that big (although it should be considered when making a third edition).	However, this DEFINITELY should NOT prevent you from getting this field guide."

Most strongly suggested the Princeton field guide, Birds of Europe, as their first pick.  Following suit, I ordered my copy from Amazon and was not in the least bit disappointed.  I used the guide daily and the combined field notes, images and species distribution maps allowed me to identify each species with ease and with confidence.

"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","This field guide has been awaited with excitement (already having existed in Swedish and Danish for a year or so) - now I know why. I have seen a huge variety of field guides, but this is simply the best yet. It covers Europe (east of Ural), Northern Africa (north of ca. 30 degrees north), and the Middle East (e.g. Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Armenia and so on). Also included is the islands of the Canaries and Madeira. All species naturally occurring (and several species not considered to be native) in this area are included. The only exception being a number of species only recorded a few times (usually meaning ones or twice) in the area. These rarities are included in a list. The species are dealt with taxonomically, and each group (e.g. Swans) starts with a short (or long in the \"hard-to-id\" groups) introduction. Each species has a text which I can only refer to as perfect. All relevant information is included (id, habitat, voice etc.). Also included is a map. However, the truly incredible thing is the drawings. Not only are they precise, they also include all kinds of plumage's and positions (often shown in a natural habitat as you would see it in the nature) that you could only wish for in most guides. Arrows (with a short and simple text) point at features of the birds especially important for identification. A thing most (if not all?) will find great is that the drawings are placed next to the text (and map) - no more endless going through pages. Incredibly it is still a handy guide. This is the field guide for the beginner as well as the pro. Sorry, I'm not able to find any bad things to say about this guide."
"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","This book covers all of the European birds and lots potential visitors. There are good plates showing variations in plumage. Field marks are pointed out on the plate, which greatly reduces potential confusion. Thin lines separate species on the plates, making it easier to know what you are  looking at on some of the more crowded plates. Text and range maps are  opposite the plates and are quite detailed with further field marks,  habitat information, identification tips, and detailed discussion of voice.  The important characteristics are in italics which make them easier to find  in the very small print. The information is incredibly thourough,  especially for a book of this size. Attention is also paid to hybrids ducks  and identification skills for gulls and waders. The range maps are clear  with migration areas also marked. The guide is small enough for use in the  field, well organized, and easy to use. The only major drawback of this  guide is that the type is very small, but the plates and the information it  contains more than make up for this problem."

Quite simply though, this book won instant recognition as the best field guide available for Europe - and perhaps a model for field guides everywhere. Its authors are well known experts in their field having spent many years studying and publishing on the birds of the region. However, the key to the guide's success is the fact that so much more useful information has been condensed into a guide which is much the same size as existing books. The book boasts excellent illustrations, succinct text and handy maps, all presented on a the same page. Small enough to fit into a pocket (about the same size as the National Geographic guide) and cheap, it is a must for anyone visiting Europe. As one reviewer has already pointed out, it is indispensable in Alaska too - not just for Palaearctic vagrants, but for regular shorebirds and some residents. Don't hesitate!"

The single deficiency is that abundancy symbols are given only for Great Britain and Ireland.		The text is lively, clear and points out helpful habits and behaviors.

"10.2307/40962198","BIRDS OF EUROPE, SECOND EDITION","0691143927","A super guide, and the newest English edition based on a Swedish original which has been translated into 13 languages and which has sold nearly three-quarters of a million copies.		Quality is the highest of any guide I've seen. Colors are true (If color is off, identification may be impossible.) The print, although small, is clear and easy to read (An exasperating number of sightings seem to occur at dusk or dawn.) and the paper is high-grade (If the book goes outside it's eventually going to get wet.)		Svensson compresses a tremendous amount into the text, and along with taxonomy and terminology, the tight, 6-page introduction offers a wealth of practical advice. The distribution maps extend well beyond Europe to the east and also take in much of North Africa. They are small, however, and unfortunately the abundance symbols, often a useful tool, are limited to England and Ireland. There's a great section at the back on vagrants and accidentals.		Mullarney's and Zetterstrom's illustrations are truly excellent and also in a class of their own. They often give multiple depictions on the ground and in-flight, both from above and below, along with examples of slight coloring variations. (Don't even think about buying a guide with photographs -- a good illustration is \"truer\" than a photo and far, far, far easier to use.)		The downside is the quality of the book may limit its usefulness in the field. The amount of information and the profusion of illustrations make it nearly twice the size (and weight) of good older guides (now out of print) and it's maybe 10-times bigger than pocket guides.		If you're going to put it on a bookshelf or pigeon-hole it in a Volvo or Land Rover along with a magnum set of binoculars, that won't matter. For a Cinquecento? A tight fit. If it needs to go in a purse, carry-on, suitcase, knapsack, backpack, saddlebags or bicycle panniers? I'd still buy it, but I'd also get a pocket guide and leave this one home or back at base-camp for later reference. Anyway, it's the kind of book it would be a shame to see beaten up."

Most birdwatching guides are illustrated by mediocre artists. Not this one. It is worth its price even if you do not care about birdwatching and you just like wildlife art. The many little illustrations showing birds in their own habitat are simply beautiful, and are a nice change from the standard \"bird on uniform background\" which are the standard for BW guides. From an artistic point of view, it's even better than Sibley's guide to the bird of North America (the one guide I recommend for the US). The book is not one of the lightest, but it's small enough that it's not much of a burden to bring it with you (it's smaller and lighter than Sibley). This is a wonderful book, certainly superior to other field guides such as the old Peterson Mountford and Hollom, which will of course remain a classic. Highly highly recommended!		P.S.
